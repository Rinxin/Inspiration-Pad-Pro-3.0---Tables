"\n<b>Augmier's Homemade Buckshot Cannon <sup>BornToBrewStuff</sup></b>\n<em>Wondrous Item, uncommon)</em>\n\nThis item consists of a metal tube the length and width of a man’s forearm attached to a glassy gray orb in front of a large reinforced wooden stock. The stock has a hole on the back you can open and pour a bag of ball bearings into as an action. It can store up to three bags of ball bearings and weighs 12 pounds regardless of how many ball bearings it has stored. As an attack action you can strike the glassy orb and it will expel a number of ball bearings of your choice, up to 1000 ball bearings (1 bag worth), with a dull thud. Interestingly the ball bearings have increasing velocity proportional to the number of ball bearings expelled.\n&
\n&
If you expel 200 or more ball bearings all creatures within a 30 foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.\n&
\n&
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\n&

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\n&
\n&
An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\n&
\n&
The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.\n&
