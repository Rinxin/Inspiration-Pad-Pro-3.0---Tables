; Revised Wild Magic Surge (5e).ipt
; created 2/27/2019 6:12:18 PM

Header: The rules are unchanged. When a sorcerer casts a spell, after the spell is cast, roll d20. If the result is 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table. Other events or actions may also result in rolling on the table. However, instead of rolling d100 and going straight in, you must first roll d20 to determine which of the 3 columns you’re going to use. 1-3 (15%) is the first column (extreme), 4-9 (30%) is the middle column (moderate), and 10-20 (55%) is the third column (nuisance).

Optional Rule: Instead of a flat 5% chance of Wild Magic Surges occurring when spells are cast, it was suggested that you roll d20 and subtract the level of the spell. If the result is 1 or less, a Wild Magic Surge occurs. This increases 1st level spells from 5% to 10%, increasing the odds by 5% each level.

A close review of the possible results will reveal the most of the effects in the original PHB table appear in this table as well. However, most of the results are new and this table has undergone moderate playtesting in my groups.
