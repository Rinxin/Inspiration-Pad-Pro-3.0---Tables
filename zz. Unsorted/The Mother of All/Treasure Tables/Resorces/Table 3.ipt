Do I really want to cart this with me?
All sets are valued at 100 gold pieces plus or minus 2%,
or in other words 98 to 102 gp. The italicized text contains
values and information reserved for the game master. In
general, the GM will not immediately read this text to the
players; it is there for the GM to use as he or she sees fit.
Roll d% and use the indicated set:
01 A small but opulent rug [45 gp] is rolled up and
tied with a golden cord. Unrolled, the rug is a
dazzling array of red, white and gold flowers,
woven in the softest, most luxuriant wool.
Beneath the rug is a folded set of clerical vestments
[12 gp], a soft-saffron yellow robe trimmed
with purple. A pectoral sewn into the vestments
shows two factions of mounted warriors armed
with long spears meeting in battle. Bits of copper
and tin give the embroidered soldiers depth and
texture. A nearby censer of polished bronze [5
gp] holds a small sample of peppermint incense
[1 sp]. A black leather satchel with a brass clasp
[2 gp] holds a blue wine bottle [8 gp], a pair of silver
and turquoise dangle earrings [17 gp], a tiny
whalebone dagger with a handle shaped like a
river trout [2 gp], and a purple and pink square
rhodochrosite [8 gp] wrapped in a crumbling
piece of parchment. The long, slender bottle is
topped with a monkey-face stopper, and is about
one fourth full of excellent champagne [2 gp].
[Total 101.10 gp]
02 A well-made bronze astrolabe [a navigational tool,
45 gp] fits perfectly in a specially designed wooden
case [12 gp] the size of a bread loaf, secured
within specially shaped recesses. The instrument
is a confusing arrangement of bronze gears and
arched pieces of iron etched with measurements
and mathematical symbols, and obviously can be
used only with specialized knowledge. The walnut
carrying case has a drawer underneath which
holds twenty sheets of blank paper [4 sp each], a
few letters from a sea captain to a trading company,
three ink pens [1 sp each] and a vial of ink
[8 gp]. In a small leather bag [1 sp] you find a silver
locket engraved with an anchor and wheel
[15 gp] and a gold pinky ring shaped like a miniature
chain [10 gp]. [Total 98.4 gp]
03 A short wooden dresser [16 gp] is covered in a
thin layer of dust, spider webs, and insect droppings;
a small wax-covered silver candlestick [2
gp] sits on its top. Inside one of the drawers,
under a moldering assortment of bed linens, you
find an old, chipped, oak crossbow wrapped in
oiled cloth to prevent rust [light crossbow, 32 gp],
and a short quiver of bolts [10 bolts, 1 gp].
Another drawer holds decaying, moth-eaten
blue towels wrapped around a pair of badly tarnished
brass gauntlets, with silver runes etched
into the palms [10 gp]. The bottommost drawer
holds, in addition to a selection of extremely tattered
socks and stockings, a small black leather
bag [1 gp] with a smoky quartz crystal [40 gp]
inside. [Total 102 gp]
04 Within an undecorated and badly dented bronze
pot [4 gp], about as high as a man’s ankle, you
find a pair of pyramid-shaped bronze bells
incised with symbolic representations of cranes
and tortoises [6 gp each]. Nearby is an earthenware
jug, yellowish black with age and decorated
with elaborate horns limiting its usability [2
gp]. Next to it is a vaguely cylindrical terra cotta
statue of a warrior [a samurai] with his hands on
the hilt of his blade [12 gp]. Though slightly
cracked and weathered, the figurine is still striking.
Wrapped in heavy canvas, you find the severed
head of a statue carved from green marble
[55 gp]. The life-sized statue depicts a proud warrior
with a bulbous nose, wide eyes, and closecropped
hair. It has been severed roughly at the
neck. One of the statue’s pupils is decorated with
pale brown jasper [15 gp], but the other eye is
bare. [Total 100 gp]
05 You find a bulls-eye lantern [10 gp] and a pair of
basilisk-hide boots [30 gp] on a small ledge [lip,
rock] sticking out from the wall. The lantern is
made of iron, coated with rust and a bit heavy
for its size. The lantern’s handle is fashioned to
look like an oak tree branch, and the door to
look like a curved leaf. The boots are folded over
in half, as each is tall enough to be worn just past
a man’s knee. They are an unusual hue, appearing
to be at times a rich, vivid blue, and at other
times a dusky indigo or purple, depending upon
the type of light touching them. A single ivoryhandled
dagger [55 gp] protrudes from a slender
pocket in the outside of the right boot. The dagger’s
handle is carved to look like a reptilian tail
and curves slightly. The blade is still dark with
dried blood. Further inspection of the boots discloses
several coins jingling in the toe [5 gp].
[Total 100 gp]
Rolled and bound with rope is a small, darkly
hued rug [21 gp]. Once the knots are broken and
the rug is unrolled, the rope begins to unravel,
the fibers breaking down from age and dehydration.
The rug, however, is in excellent condition.
Made of thick wool, it appears to be quilted
in places, as if its purpose was to lend comfort
to a devout worshipper’s knees while in prayer.
Patterns of clouds, storms, ocean waves and
tranquil rivers [or gems, majestic caverns and
noble mountain peaks; or dragons, each of varying
hue, size and breed] decorate the rug. Wrapped in
a leaf of paper [1sp] is a tiny brass idol of a dragon
[78 gp], as well as a single gold piece [1 gp].
The dragon is intricately wrought to appear as if
in flight, its small wings unfurled, its noble snout
raised and sharp teeth bared. Where once were
undoubtedly gems for eyes are now two empty
hollows. [Total 100.1 gp]
07 In a long wooden box is a heavy crossbow, plain
and sleek. It is in good repair [50 gp]. Twenty
bolts, carefully crafted and uniform, are in a simple
leather carrying case [bolts, 2 gp; case, 5 gp].
Beside them is a white leather container about
the width and length of a large man’s finger [5
sp]. Inside you find a number of hatpins[14].
Most are plain metal with extra-large round
heads, although three have oval heads painted
white [13 pins, 1 sp each]. One has a small polished
golden stone mounted on the end [agate;
pin, 2 gp]. Under the leather container is a piece
of unbleached linen large enough for a halfling
to wear as a cloak [2 gp]. Underneath the linen,
a tall silver goblet covered with raised decorations
featuring wrestlers lies on its side [15 gp],
and around it are loose coins [17 gp, 34 sp 7 cp].
[Total 98.27 gp]
08 A small sea chest [2 gp] contains a thick blue
blanket [wool, 5 sp], a candleholder of greenstained
metal [copper] with a handle [5 sp], a
bundle of six ordinary wax candles [8 cp], and a
pair of medium-sized fine gloves of calfskin, dyed
bright red [8 gp]. The gloves have had some wear
and the palms and fingers are paler red than the
backs. The chest also holds a hand ax, with a
plain steel blade and complex painting [perhaps
charms] on the haft [10 gp], two eating plates of
worked copper [5 sp each], an hourglass with ends
of a rich brown wood [25 gp], and a pair of new
leather boots to fit a middle-sized man [10 gp].
On the bottom of the chest you find a number of
coins [30 gp, 31 sp, 3 cp] and a round brass
amulet with the figure of a man [holy symbol, 10
gp]. [Total 100.21 gp]
09 Opening a cork-stopped gourd [3 cp] you find
several pieces of relatively inexpensive jewelry.
There is a copper ring topped by square-cut
banded agate [10 gp], a gold-plated nose ring
etched with spiraling lines [4 gp], a calico moss
agate the size of a large pea [11 gp], and a small
silver pendant showing a woman in a long
flowing dress dancing lovingly with a bear on
its hind legs [22 gp]. Tangled with this, you find
a slender silver chain bracelet with an onyx
bead [29 gp]. In the bottom is a tiny silver whistle
in the shape of a robin [2 gp], a small cube
of milk-white halite [3 gp], and an ivory ring
with an inset figure 8 of smooth onyx [20 gp].
[Total 101.03 gp]
10 Inside a badly tanned leather backpack [1 gp],
you discover a rolled bundle of five grey-andwhite
beaver pelts [3 gp each]. A pair of leather
boots [2 gp], stuffed with old grass, is tied to the
pack’s frame. A comfortable down bedroll [1 gp],
complete with a warm brown cotton blanket [5
sp] has been tied down to the pack’s underside.
Buried among the pelts, you discover two light
iron beaver traps, flecked with old blood, still
reeking of musk [20 gp each]. A pair of unlabeled
ceramic vials [5 sp each] is filled with a smelly
yellow liquid [urine, used to bait the traps; no
value]. Two simple daggers [2 gp each] with lightning
bolts carved into their wood handles are
wrapped in cowhide and stuffed into an inside
pocket. Four well-balanced hand axes [8 gp each],
similarly decorated, are tied together in another
pocket. A third pocket is stuffed with candles [5,
1 cp each], flint and steel [1 gp], a wooden mallet
[5 sp], four fishhooks [1 sp each] and twine [8 feet,
1 cp], and a pair of pliers [3 gp]. [Total 101.46 gp]
11 A pink and white ornamental water jug [5 gp],
taller than a man’s knee, is filled to the brim
with tiny ceramic treasures. You discover a flock
of orange and yellow clay birds the size of walnuts
[92 birds, 2 cp each], several pairs of clay or
bone dice [5 pairs clay dice, 2 cp each; 8 pairs bone
dice, 6 cp each], some small terracotta wolves and
bears dyed blue or orange [15 bears, 18 cp each;
12 wolves, 11 cp each], and an exquisite statue of
a long graceful female, hands on her hips, nearly
nude save for painted golden arm bands and a
complicated array of molded neck and hip
chains [47 gp]. Below these are a palm-sized
sphinx of gold and amber clay [14 sp], several
terracotta models of one- and two-story homes
with painted-on windows [15 buildings, 2 sp
each], a granite mortar and pestle [4 gp], and a
variety of foreign coins [8 gp, 67 sp, 46 cp] and a
single small orange-red stone [carnelian, 20 gp].
[Total 102 gp]
12 Five black and gold vases of various shapes, decorated
by wavy designs, stair step patterns, and
checkerboards sit clustered together on a dusty
floor [8 gp each]. Inside one of the jugs, you dis-
23
the mother of all treasure tables
24
table III: 100 gold pieces
cover a rich assortment of gold, silvery and copper
coins, stamped with horses, goats, and sheep
[1 pp, 26 gp, 97 sp, 142 cp]. Inside another jug,
you find more than a hundred wooden rings
carved with lucky sigils [117 rings, 2 cp each], and
in a third jug, you uncover a rolled silk scroll
covered in neat figures [kanji] depicting a lone
warrior [shogun] leading an army of pikemen into
battle [8 gp]. In the fourth jar are crescentshaped
honey candies [52 pieces, 1 cp each]. A
final jug holds forty green-feathered arrows [2
gp]. [Total 99.98 gp]
13 In a bag you find a pair of heavy leather
gauntlets for hands smaller than average among
fighting men [3 gp], a plain long white flannel
bed shirt and a simple white flannel cap [mansized
sleep wear, 2 sp] and a heavy copper necklace
set with seven tiny pearls [necklace 10 gp,
pearls 5 gp each, 45 gp in all]. There is a workman’s
hammer and a square of wood. The hammer
has a plain wood handle and a simple iron
head without claws [5 sp]. The square of wood is
polished, small enough to fit into your hand, and
has a hinge on the side. When you open it, you
find a polished steel mirror [15 gp]. Also in the
bag is a small metal box [silver], inlaid with colored
enamel triangles [22 gp]. Inside is a pack of
heavy paper playing cards [5 gp]. Loose on the
bottom are several coins [6 gp, 18 sp, 9 cp]. [Total
98.59 gp]
14 Lying in the corner between the wall and the
floor, a gleam of metal catches your attention;
resting there is what appears to be a thick metal
walking staff [56 gp], about as long as a young
woman is tall. On closer inspection you see the
walking staff’s handle is actually a small
warhammer, its handle inlaid with brass. If you
gently pull the handle the walking staff reveals
its secrets even further, and a slender sword
emerges from its hidden scabbard. Nearly hidden
in the shadows of the corner is a miniature silver
carriage [44 gp], a child’s toy perhaps. The carriage
– which could fit on an elf’s palm – is a
remarkable work of craftsmanship, complete
with moving wheels and tiny doors that open
and close. The seats inside the carriage are lined
with dark green velvet. [Total 100 gp]
15 Under a blue blanket [wool, 3 gp] lays a copper
hooded lantern [7 gp], a large pair of pants [linen,
2 gp] and a loop of hemp rope [50 ft, 1 gp].
Wrapped in linen [1 gp] is a well-made
longsword [40 gp]. The blade is unadorned, and
the crosshilt is set with two small yellow gems
[tigereye]. A dagger is tucked by the tip of the
sword. It is totally different from the sword. It is
made entirely of black metal and the slightly
curved blade is jagged on both sides [3 gp]. A
gray metal container sits beside the sword. It is
quite round with a narrow opening in the top
that flares out slightly [like a vase; silver, 20 gp]. If
you pick it up, it is heavy and rattles [coins have
been dropped inside; 24 gp, 6 sp]. [Total 101.6 gp]
16 In a sack [1 sp] you find a large, half-burned yellow
candle [3 cp], two thin gray blankets [wool, 2
sp ea], a heavy black skillet [iron, 2 sp], an old,
large wooden spoon [2 cp], a mink pelt [20 gp], a
rabbit pelt [2 gp], and a black leather belt, carefully
made with inconspicuous, very fine tooling
along its length. However, the buckle is missing
and was very sloppily cut off [3 gp]. The sack also
holds a coil of coarse rope [1 gp], a pair of
gauntlets of heavy cowhide dyed black, held by
solid iron rivets reworked to look like stars [5 gp],
and a silver key [1 gp]. Loose at the bottom are
various coins and black and white stones. [7 gp,
19 sp, 33 cp; 2 pieces of obsidian 10 gp each; 1
small piece of onyx, 20 gp; 2 pieces of quartz 10 gp
each] [Total 101.98 gp]
17 A cube-shaped iron carrying case [6 gp] with a
wooden handle is roughly large enough to hold a
jug of wine. Its sides are blue painted panels and
it is secured with a simple brass and steel lock [20
gp]. Inside it has several niches, which hold
items of various sizes. One is a paper fan [3 gp]
with a black paint drawing of a sunset over a distant
harbor. You find an empty steel flask with
gold knotwork trim [5 gp] and a pair of bronze
hand bells shaped like wild pigs [5 gp each]. A
pair of sharp silver spurs, the rowels shaped like
deer antlers [10 gp], rests in a specially designed
indentation. Another niche holds a miniature
scroll case containing several small rocks [9 sp].
Among the common stones are two small
seashells [1 cp each] and a faceted clear yellow
stone [citrine, 47 gp]. [Total 101.92 gp]
18 You find a rectangular leather case with tarnished
brass caps on its corners, and a worn carrying
strap [50 gp]. A smiling goblin’s face has
been tooled into the front of the case. Inside the
case are all of the elements of a disguise kit –
false mustaches, makeup, hair dye and so forth –
along with a scroll case [1 gp] full of coins [10 sp,
300 cp], a small steel mirror [10 gp] and three
pairs of black kid-leather gloves, sized for adults
[5 gp per set]. Two gems have been tucked into
the fingers of one of these gloves: a dark green
stone [moss agate, 10 gp] and an irregular chunk
of pale blue crystal [blue quartz, 10 gp]. [Total 100
gp]
19 You see a wooden box, an arm’s-length in width
and a third less than that in depth [77 gp]. The
box’s hinged top slopes gently, and is decorated
with a painting of a four-masted sailing ship
25
against a setting sun. Thick, soft velvet, dyed a
deep blue, covers the bottom of the box. A single
brass latch, set in the front of the box, can be
rotated to open the slanted top, whereupon the
many drawers and compartments inside the box
are revealed. This was most likely a writing box,
and a lap desk. Within one of the drawers you
find a silver seal [18 gp], wrought in the likeness
of the ship on the lid. Another of the drawers is
filled with tobacco, but the leaves have grown
stale and flavorless due to age. In yet another
drawer you find copper coins [87 cp], and in still
another you find silver and gold [2 gp, 21 sp].
[Total 99.97 gp]
20 A large heavy sack contains a length of fine
brown silk [3 yards, 30 gp], a plain gold cup too
small for a halfling to get a good drink [25 gp]
and a large piece of carved white rock. The carving
is two hands long and is the head of a man
with an aquiline nose and thinning hair. It was
obviously broken off from a larger sculpture [5
gp]. Beside it you find an iron mace as long as
your arm and studded with pointed spikes longer
than a finger [12 gp]. A ball of thick white yarn
[1 gp] has tangled all around the mace and its
spikes. There’s also a small shiny round metal
cylinder with a cap that holds toothpicks [cylinder
silver 5 gp, toothpicks 1 cp]. Scattered across
the bottom are coins and 2 pale blue gems, [19
sp, 25 cp, and 2 pieces of blue quartz, 10 gp each]
[Total 100.16 gp]
21 A sack of bright orange saffron cloth [3 sp]
hangs from the tip of an ornate trident, whose
triple iron points have been forged in the image
of three intertwined, dancing swordfish [32 gp].
The sack bulges with plunder. Inside is a pile of
intermixed coins from the mints of various port
cities [28 gp, 112 sp, 696 cp]. Among the wealth
are a pair of smooth soapstone nose rings, often
worn by slaves as a symbol of their status [25
sp], a trio of loose malachite chips [5 gp each]
obviously pried from rings, and a badly tarnished
copper broach engraved with a hunting
dog insignia [5 gp]. In addition to the valuables,
the sack is filled with an assortment of honey
candies wrapped in colorful waxed paper [1 sp
for the lot], most of which are still good. [Total
101.06 gp]
22 A lacquered oak chest, large enough to hold a
large dog comfortably, has been reinforced with
copper banding and polished to a mirror finish [5
gp]. Lifting the lid, you discover a quartet of stoppered
glass bottles, each filled with a smoky
amber whiskey [21 gp each]. The paper label
glued to each square whiskey bottle is hand
labeled, indicating these spirits have been aging
for nearly a century and a half and come from a
very reputable brewery. The ship-and-lighthouse
seal of a noble merchant house has been pressed
onto the bottles’ stoppers with red wax. In addition
to the whiskey, you find a layer of bright
feathers in a dizzying array of colors used as packthe
mother of all treasure tables
26
table III: 100 gold pieces
ing material: neon reds, yellows, greens, and arctic
blues. Lost in the feathers, you find a bronze
pendant molded as a grimacing face with
demonic eyes accented by black-painted pupils
[11 gp]. [Total 100 gp]
23 A wooden chest the size of a large dog is covered
in elaborate enamel and lacquer work showing a
bare-chested young king in a war chariot leading
great hunts and war parties [25 gp]. Inside, you
find a black marble statue the size of a forearm
depicting a stiff armed, bare-chested warrior
standing at rigid attention [10 gp], and a black
granite carving of a bull with the bearded head
of a scholar [18 gp] which is a similar size. The
sculptures are padded by straw underneath them.
Concealed in the straw is a black glass jar [2 gp]
containing a scented yellow ointment. The
straw also hides a white leather pouch [2 gp],
which is so stuffed with gold and silver coins [21
gp, 126 sp] that the tie will not close all the way.
At the bottom of the chest, you find a light
bronze necklace appointed with comma-shaped
blue beads [9 gp]. [Total 99.6 gp]
24 A wooden chest covered in floral carvings [3 gp]
contains a small array of arms and armor. Atop
the pile of leather and metal, you find a steel
buckler inlaid with gold tracery in abstract maze
patterns [17 gp]. A scimitar [30 gp] with an ivory
duck carved into the hilt rests within a leather
scabbard secured with silver bands and clasps [3
gp]. A set of grey leather armor decorated with
white flowers [10 gp] is tossed haphazardly atop a
set of four iron throwing daggers decorated with
copper embossing [2 gp each]. An iron banded
flail with steel striking heads [10 gp] is tossed
under the armor. Beneath all the weaponry, you
find a palm-sized book of epic poetry [5 gp] with
a brilliant red and black cover. Tucked into the
book is a single platinum strip [15 gp], as long as
a woman’s finger, and thin as a knife blade. The
platinum strip is stamped with the portrait of an
armor-clad king with a sundisk radiating out
behind his head. [Total 101 gp]
25 Inside a dyed purple coin purse closed with an
intricate bronze latch [19 gp], you discover a
small trove of wealth. Though the purse is only
the size of a strong man’s fist, its contents are
quite valuable. You discover a fat handful of gold
and silver coins, all stamped with royal insignia
and intricate heraldry [26 gp, 44 sp]. A golden
signet ring [42 gp], polished so expertly you can
see your face in the metal, gleams in the light.
On the ring’s face, a knight’s helm and pair of
manacles suggest its former owner’s profession.
Perhaps this ring once belonged to a sheriff or
law-giving knight. A tiny silver key dangling
from a fine silver chain [8 gp] is tangled around
the signet ring. The key is the perfect size to
open a locket or diary. [Total 99.4 gp]
26 You examine the wooden crate and see it is of a
very simple design [1 gp]. Planks are nailed
together to form a square, wooden box, as wide
and long as a man’s arm. It takes only minimal
effort to pry some of the boards apart from the
rest of the container. Your eyes and nose are
assailed by dust, which flies into the air as you
remove the boards. As the dust settles you see
the corked tops of ten bottles resting in a thick
bed of sawdust. Lifting each one out carefully
you find ten well-aged liquors. There are three
bottles of red wine, which each have a label that
dates them from almost one hundred years ago
[30 gp]; two bottles of brandy that bear the label
of a well-known local tavern [16 gp]; four bottles
that bear only a simple label, which states the
contents of the bottles [whiskey, 20 gp]; and a
single over-sized bottle containing a label with
the word “wine-ale” [one gallon of a very potent
and tasty mixture of white wine and dark ale, 35 gp].
[Total 102 gp]
27 A large man’s pentagonal oak and bronze coffin,
decorated with religious paintings and inscribed
with holy calligraphy [12 gp], has been emptied
of its original contents and used as a treasure
trove. A shirt of cobalt blue scale mail [63 gp]
has been laid inside; each iron scale has been
painted a rich blue, and decorated with a simple
runic motif, rendered in navy, giving the armor a
deep, shadowy and multilayered appearance. A
mostly complete set of thieves’ tools [15 gp],
wrapped in green velvet, rests in one of the
armor’s sleeves. Though missing a few picks, and
the files dulled through long use, the set of burglar
tools remains effective. A sheaf of high quality
arrows [1 gp], lashed together with catgut, lies
next to the armor. Long searching reveals a sliver
of diamond the size of an apple seed wedged in
one of the coffin’s joints [10 gp]. [Total 101 gp]
28 You find a smoothly carved wooden jar shaped
like a squatting, pensive woman whose arms rest
on her knees [4 gp]. Opening the jar’s elongated
skull gives access to the contents inside. A silver
chain-link necklace holds a silver dragonfly pendant
with green-tinted mother of pearl wings [17
gp]. An heavy iron ring is inlaid with thin
streams of gold and platinum around its circumference
[6 gp]. A piece of linen is wrapped
around a small golden vulture pendant [24 gp]
inlaid with black and blue cloisonné glass. A
wide, pounded copper bracelet [4 gp] gleams
dully next to a small, undecorated bronze flask
[whiskey, 4gp]. At the bottom of the jar, a short,
thick knobby blue glass [1 gp] is half buried in a
pile of coins. These are antique hexagonal coins
27
in bronze and silver [48 silver coins, 48 sp; 62
bronze coins, 31 cp; coins may be of more value to
a collector]. Also mixed in with the coins is a
small round moonstone [36 gp]. [Total 101.11 gp]
29 You find a rolled piece of parchment, an armslength
long and half that wide, cut into a rectangle
with crisp symmetrical ends [4 sp]. Beside
it is a doll, dressed as a lady of fashion. She is as
long as your forearm. The face and hands are
wood, painstakingly painted to smile engagingly.
Her hair is real hair, pale blond; her gown, shoes,
and hat are made of the finest fabrics [20 gp]. A
plain longsword in a wooden sheath is under the
doll. Its basket hilt is wrought iron, the blade
sharp and unadorned [sword, 15 gp; sheath, 1gp].
There is an uncomplicated well-made lock with
the key in it [40 gp lock and key]. You also find a
wooden spoon [2 cp] and a brass plate, rather
dented [2 sp] beside a tall plain silver goblet decorated
with raised leaves [15 gp]. The goblet
holds a handful of coins [8 gp, 7 sp, 2 cp]. [Total
100.34 gp]
30 In a sack you find two brass loop earrings [2 gp
each], a silver bracelet [12 gp], and a small shirt
[halfling, gnome or child-sized], embroidered all
over with pastel stylized flowers [6 gp]. A short
sword in a sheath runs the length of the sack.
The blade is plain, the hilt bound in leather [10
gp]. The oiled leather sheath is plain but sturdy
[2 gp]. Below it is a thick candle marked with
lines to tell time, half burned [1 sp], a yellow silk
scarf [10 gp] stuck with a slightly ornate silver
stickpin [11 gp] and a small leather-bound book,
partly filled with writing [a journal of travel, 15
gp]. There are four wool socks [5 sp together] and
a ball of string [5 sp]. In the toe of one sock are
coins [9 gp, 20 sp, 30 cp] and a heavy bronze
medallion with an image on it [of a war god; 20
gp]. [Total 100.4 gp]
31 A simple wooden peg latch secures the battered
oak toolkit [2 sp]. The unpainted box itself is
about the size of a loaf of bread, and its exterior
is badly scarred by knife cuts and splattered with
multi-colored droplets of paint. Inside the toolbox,
you find an array of masterwork tinker’s
tools: small hammers, awls, files, rasps, needles
and thread in a half dozen different colors [55
gp]. Though old, the tools are in good repair,
neatly cleaned and wrapped in fragrant oilcloth.
A smattering of silver coins [39 sp] and around a
dozen small gems are mixed in with the tools.
The miniscule gems are mostly uncut and flawed
rubies [16 gp]. At the bottom of the tool case,
half buried amid sawdust and breadcrumbs, you
discover a large agate, the size of a baby’s fist, cut
and polished into a perfect oval [25 gp]. [Total
100.1 gp]
32 A collection of weapons lies forgotten under a
grimy, moth-eaten wolf pelt [5 cp]. A plain flail
protrudes haphazardly from the side of the stack
[8 gp]. Below the pelt, a heavy iron mace [14 gp]
covered in skull and bones motifs, with a handle
etched into the form of a capering skeleton, is at
the top of the pile. Below the mace you find a
pair of wickedly serrated sickles with morbidly
etched handles [6 gp each] and a burnished rosewood
light crossbow [37 gp] with a golden houseseal
hammered into the hilt. Thirty bolts with
blue-and-red fletching [3 gp] are arranged in a
ragged canvas bandolier with plenty of pockets
[2 sp]. A great ax [21 gp] rests at the bottom of
the pile, its blade made of some metal with a
strange green cast. The blade has been scored
with a complicated maze pattern, which flashes
aquamarine in the light. A matching dagger [5
gp] lies beside it. [Total 100.25 gp]
33 Two items lie near each other in the gloom
[dusty light, torch light, day light, moon light]. The
larger of the two is what appears to be a hunting
cleaver [65 gp] of a noble. The weapon’s hilt is
dressed with bronze and ends with the stylized
head of a hunting hound. The handle is fashioned
from a dark, almost black wood. The scabbard
depicts a scene of a goddess hunting wild
boar with her dogs. The blade is still quite sharp,
and tucked into a compartment along the scabbard
is a small fork. The second and smaller
piece appears to be a bronze, clawed table foot
[35 gp], grown pale from verdigris but quite
heavy. It does not seem large enough to have
supported a dining or banquet table, but may
possibly have been used to support a desk or a
lady’s dressing table. [Total 100 gp]
34 A single iron gauntlet sized to fit an ogre warrior-
prince [4 gp] has been pressed into service as
an improvised “treasure chest.” A piece of knotted
canvas fills the wrist opening to keep the
contents secure within the pitted, battle-scarred
gauntlet. A pair of dice carved from quality ivory
[4 gp] rattles around within the glove along with
variously sized coins [15 gp, 13 sp, and 5 cp]. A
small golden letter opener with a sapphire set
into the mushroom-shaped pommel [12 gp] protrudes
from one of the fingers. A small gold and
onyx amulet, shaped like a stylized warhammer
and covered in protective runes and inscribed
prayers [59 gp], is stuck between the gauntlet’s
palm and one of its fingers. A slender yellow
ceramic perfume vial [3 gp], contents long
spilled, rests in the gauntlet’s little finger. Basrelief
pictograms of bees decorate the vial. [Total
98.35 gp]
35 In a backpack you find a length of fine rope [silk,
50 feet, 10 gp], two heavy gauntlets of gray
the mother of all treasure tables
28
table III: 100 gold pieces
leather [2 gp] and a spool of strong black thread
[3 cp]. Two large-eyed needles stick in the thread
coils [needles, 5 sp each]. A small ornate metal
box [5 sp] lies underneath. It is silver colored [tin]
with raised golden designs [copper wire]. The top
pries off to reveal a pack of heavy paper playing
cards [5 gp]. In a linen bag are three tightly rolled
strips of cloth, a one-edged blade, a pair of plain
tweezers and three round boxes. Two of the
boxes are partially full of salves with herbal
smells, each different. The third looks used but is
empty [healer’s kit, 40 gp]. At the bottom of the
pack are coins [2 sp, 5 cp]. Wedged between the
seams you find 3 coins [3 gp] and a flawed, redspeckled
gem [bloodstone 40 gp]. [Total 101.78 gp]
36 You catch sight of a bright and colorful tangle,
packed inside an octagonal bronze and glass display
case [10 gp]. Opening the latch, you reach
into the dusty case and first pull out a child’s
mobile [32 gp], hand crafted from bronze, for the
babe of some noble. It is adorned with dangling
cloth animals in a rainbow of colors, hung by a
delicate gold chains. Tangled in the mobile is an
ivory rattle [15 gp], shaped like a noblewoman’s
perfectly-coiffed head. A leather teething ring,
wrapped in saffron-yellow ribbons [4 sp] lies
beside a floppy stuffed bunny rabbit of pink wool
[4 sp], which in turn rests atop a baby’s blanket
[20 gp], made from scraps of velvets and silks. A
leather belt pouch with a tin catch [2 gp] contains
an unusual treasure: a large silver nugget,
the size of an apricot [14 gp], as well as a small
magenta pyrope crystal [garnet] still lodged in its
stone matrix [5 gp]. [Total 98.8 gp]
37 A cold-weather garment, sewn of tough travelworn
black leather and thick indigo-dyed wool is
folded in a large ball, secured by a sturdy leather
belt. Once the belt is unbuckled the heavy garment
opens to reveal its true identity as a welltailored,
belted winter coat [18 gp], complete
with several pockets in the interior lining as well
as in the cuffs of both sleeves. The coat is lined
with sheepskin and has a high, leather collar,
and is sized to fit a male dwarf of good stature.
Tucked within the interior pockets are 4 flasks
[80gp] of a viscous, brightly colored liquid, which
upon closer inspection is revealed to be
alchemist’s fire. Each flask is of pleasing design
and made of thick glass: some are adorned with
floral patterns, others with bold geometric
shapes. Each stopper is made of thick glass with
cork at one end and a metal hinge to keep the
stopper in place. [Total 98 gp]
38 In a big wooden box [1 gp] you find four square
black napkins of fine linen about a handspan
wide, embroidered with a lily in black silk thread
[3 sp each], and a medium-sized black iron cooking
pot, slightly rusty on the bottom [5 sp]. There
is no lid. A pair of short swords, or long daggers,
lay beside the pot. They are identical: well balanced
and made of fine steel, a little longer than
a man’s forearm, with dark wood handles
wrapped in leather [30 gp together]. Under the
napkin lies a book, with covers of hinged wood
painted white and pages cut of a coarse paper [10
gp]. The pages are blank. In the bottom corner of
the box are about three score coins [13 gp, 21 sp,
35 cp]. Among the coins are 6 gray metal buttons
[pewter] each set with a tiny irregular pearl [freshwater
pearls; buttons 7 gp each]. [Total 100.15 gp]
39 You find part of the barding [50 gp] for a pony.
The crinet, which covers the animal’s neck, has
overlapping pieces of plate mail fastened together
with strips of black leather. Each piece of
metal is decorated with inscriptions in Dwarven
tongue: “Valor”, “Strength”, and “Steadfastness”.
Next to the barding is a small wooden cabinet,
about four hands tall and two hands wide with
two doors fastened in the middle by a simple
latch. The top of the cabinet rises in a single
spire topped with an ornate wooden star. Once
opened, the doors reveal a beautifully painted
altar [50 gp]. The altar has three shelves; each
painted a different shade of blue. Nubs of candles
still cling to the lowest shelf, wax and wicks
blackened from repeated use. The rear interior
wall of the altar is decorated with hammered tin
in the shape of seven-pointed stars. [Total 100 gp]
40 A supple kid leather backpack fitted with silver
clasps [2 gp] is opened to reveal its riches. Stored
within are seven small books [12 gp each], their
pages yellowed with age and use, and their black
leather covers turning a dark sepia with exposure.
Each of the books has had scholarly notes
written in the margins by a shaky, fussy hand
wielding blue shellfish ink. The seven books deal
with natural science or folk medicine, and have
titles like “The Leather Wings of the Bats of
Calvernus Delve”, “Folk Medicine of the
Antonian Mountains”, and “Richfeld’s Guide to
Common Cave Spiders”. A bottle of black ink [8
gp], copper ink pens [2 gp total], and some sheets
of parchment [8 sheets, 16 sp] are found in various
compartments of the pack. A few fingernailsized
silver coins and square copper coins with a
hole at their center are also discovered [foreign
coins; 16 sp, 25 cp]. [Total 99.45 gp]
41 A dozen colorful round shields [4 gp each] are
stacked neatly on a wooden [or bamboo] storage
frame [2 gp]. The light wooden shields are painted
in a rainbow of brilliant colors, including leaf
green, fiery red and vibrant blue and gold. Floral
designs, triangles, and castle-and-sword designs
all can be seen on the shields. Behind the frame,
you discover an overstuffed leather sack [1 gp]
containing several hundred copper coins [932 cp].
Tied to the side of the frame is an iron and leather
helm topped with a magenta horsetail, reinforced
at the back by a short apron of chainmail which
protects the shoulders and neck [9 gp]. Inside the
helm, you find a secret pocket just under the crest
that holds a multifaceted, well-cut jet the size of
a ladybug [30 gp]. [Total 99.32 gp]
42 You lift the lid of a small wooden box [5 sp] to
find three rings of twisted wire [two silvery and
one golden], a small mirror, and a bottle. The
rings would never fit a fighting man, but they are
large enough to go around most women’s wrists
[bracelets: silver, 5 sp each; gold, 2 gp]. Slight
scratches mar the mirror’s surface but its wooden
back holds a geometric design of red, beige and
cream woods, cleverly constructed and with no
scratches or signs of wear [18 gp]. The bottle is
deep green [glass, 4 gp] and closed with a tightly
wedged waxed cork. If you remove the cork, you
find a dark, thick aromatic liquid. The smell is
sweetly floral and clings [perfume, 25 gp].
Scattered along the bottom of the box are coins
[13 gp, 15 sp, 9 cp] and a small faceted stone of
clear yellow [citrine 35 gp]. [Total 100.09 gp]
43 Inside a small lacquered basket [or wooden chest],
you find a long sheet of oilcloth [5 cp] wrapped
around a large silver decanter. A spiral design is
carved around the outside of the decanter. The
scrollwork is exquisite, and the decanter shows
no sign of ever having been used [60 gp]. At the
bottom of the basket [or chest] is a pouch full of
coins [7 gp, 30 sp] and a short clay jar with a
wooden lid. The jar is stuffed with wads of shredded
cloth, and nestled in its center are three
chunks of irregular, bright blue stones [lapis
lazuli, 10 gp each]. [Total 100.05 gp]
44 Inside a heavy bronze goblet [10 gp] decorated
with the image of a beatific saint with hands
clasped in prayer, you find a collection of religious
artifacts and sacrificial coins. Among the artifacts
are a silver ring with a small tourmaline, pale
pink on one edge and darkening to violet at the
other [55 gp]; a thin golden medallion depicting
an agonized martyr dying on the wheel [20 gp];
and a set of wooden prayer beads affixed to a supple
copper chain [4 gp]. A miniature silver dagger
whose hilt and blade have been inlaid with a
golden lattice pattern [9 gp] rests blade down in
the bronze chalice. A few sticks of cinnamonscented
incense [2 gp] are wrapped in an off-white
linen handkerchief [4 sp]. [Total 100.4 gp]
45 A bronze-covered book lies atop a pile of linen
robes in regal purple and white with ermine trim
[courtier’s outfit, 30 gp]. The small book is fastened
with a copper lock. [If opened:] The pages
are written in a tight, calligraphic script and illuminated
with colorful geometric designs [holy
book with simple lock, 30 gp]. Other items are
piled haphazardly on and under the robes. A
long, narrow piece of folded white linen [for a
turban, 8 gp] lies neatly next to a scattering of
ivory hairpins [6 pins, 1 gp each]. A small wooden
pipe with a stem shaped like a wavy desert
viper [2 gp] is tied to a brown silk bag [2 gp] filled
with savory pipeweed [1 pound, 5 sp]. A beige
cotton bag decorated with miniscule black and
orange beads [3 gp] holds a day’s worth of dates,
cheese and nuts [3 sp]. A piece of green silk [4 gp]
can be seen under the other fabric; it is wrapped
around a scimitar [15 gp] whose metal scabbard is
etched with an elaborate maze pattern. [Total
100.8 gp]
46 You find a fat package about a handspan wide,
tied up with coarse string [3 feet, 1 cp]. It is a
folded square of heavyweight, waxed brown
paper [8 sp]. Opening it you discover two pieces
of rolled blue cloth, another paper folded and
sealed, and a black velvet pouch. In one piece of
cloth [1 sp], you find a long, angular piece of jetblack
stone with a few iron shavings clinging to
it [magnetite – slightly magnetic; 10 gp]. The other
piece of cloth [1 sp] is wrapped around a heavy
gold ring incised with a diamond pattern [34 gp].
The sealed paper [2 sp] contains a pair of long,
serpentine copper earrings [6 gp], a bronze ring
carved with a lucky symbol [horseshoe] on its face
[5 gp], and an oval lapis lazuli [15 gp]. In the velvet
pouch [2 gp] are an oval piece of blue quartz
[8 gp], a copper bracelet engraved with seashells
[6 gp], and an eye agate the size of a fly [14 gp].
[Total 101.21 gp]
47 An unusual hexagonal chest [5 gp], the size of a
child’s chest and carved from a fragrant greenish
wood, opens to reveal its contents. A watercolor
print of a lake scene decorates the inside lid.
Within the case, you discover four vials of perfume
and ointment [5 gp each], all stored in virtually
identical black glass tubes; the only way to
tell the fragrances apart is by the relief carvings
decorating the stoppers. Dried monkey’s paws
[useful as a spell component or possibly as an
aphrodesiac, 2 pounds, 1 gp each] fill the case, and
offer a peak of a white sack. Concealed within
the sack are a single turquoise, shaped into a perfect
blue sphere the size of a robin’s egg [55 gp], a
malachite carving of a stalking cat, designed as a
pendant [16 gp], and a pea-sized cube of shiny
cobalt [4 gp]. [Total 102 gp]
48 Opening a round bronze chest with a gold and
silver sun disk emblazoned on the lid [18 gp], you
discover a series of bucklers and small wooden
29
the mother of all treasure tables
shields, nested one inside the other. A matched
pair of high quality bronze bucklers [30 gp each]
rests atop the shields, their inscribed faces
depicting leaping rabbits, with such amazing
detail that every line of fur is visible. Three
wooden shields [3 gp each] are colorfully painted,
each in a different primary color. A canary yellow
shield is decorated with blue and black
chevrons, while a fiery red shield is decorated
with a diagonal argent [silver] band and amber
crosses. An electric-blue shield is decorated with
silver fish swimming through a green river of
curling line work. Scattered between the shields
are a collection of mixed silver and copper coins
[98 sp, 182 cp]. [Total 98.62 gp]
49 A small bag of white linen [1 sp] is tied with a
thin red string. Within it is a smaller black sack
and a silver box [95 gp], twice the size of a man’s
palm, and wrought to look like a perfect replica
of a turtle. The black sack holds seven iron nails
[3 cp each] each the length of a woman’s smallest
finger and several gold coins [5 gp]. The silver
turtle has two hinges on one side of the shell, but
no visible latch or lock. [It is a music box. If the
turtle’s tail is lightly pressed upon, the hinges of the
shell unlatch and the box opens slightly. When the
shell is lifted open, tiny elven dancers twirl upon a
polished silver surface and a melody begins to play.
Certain notes are out of tune because of damage
done to the miniature gears within the box, but the
song is still beautiful.] [Total 100.31 gp]
50 Half-hidden beneath a pile of dirty rags and
other detritus is a magnificently tooled military
saddle [65 gp]. The saddle is made of deep crimson
leather, with black leather braided edging
and tassels adorning a high frontispiece and low
backrest. There are strange, even scratches to
the right of the frontispiece – four parallel marks
and a diagonal line through the four. This is
repeated several more times. The saddle is sized
for a human woman of medium stature. Placed
next to the saddle is a curious object – a small,
brass tube with a heavy disk at one end. It almost
looks like some manner of spyglass, until you
look through it: then, as you turn the disk on its
axel, you can see sprays of color turn and gyrate
as bits of colored glass embedded in the large
disk move along their orbit. Even in the gloomy
light [In the light of the fires; In the light of day] the
trinket provides an amusing show of color and
shapes [35 gp]. [Total 100 gp]
51 Several items are wrapped in a long, wide silk
scarf of a shocking red edged by gold-colored
fringe with tiny bronze bells and canary yellow
tassels [a sari; 38 gp]. A string of painted wooden
beads [6 sp] is wrapped around a silver-handled
flywhisk [11 gp]. The horsehair whisk is capped
with a silver globe at the end of the long, thin
handle. A scimitar [16 gp] with stylized insects
and beasts on the hilt rests within a scabbard
decorated with red enamel flowers. There is also
an elaborately decorated silver carafe with a
trumpeting elephant for its spout [If examined,
the interior shows stains; it must usually hold tea or
some other strong beverage. 35 gp]. Every bit of the
slender pot is covered by wonderfully detailed
scenes of an exotic jungle, etched into the metal
and accented with gold. [Total 100.6 gp]
52 A box holds a longsword with a basket hilt of
plain steel. The blade is sharp and true but has
plainly seen a lot of service and has had nicks
filed out. [15 gp] There is a shortbow, beautifully
decorated with leaf painting [32 gp] and 16 pale,
yellow-fletched arrows [8 sp]. Beside them you
find an artificial rose of wire and thin metal
painted red [2 gp], a gold ribbon and a grey metal
cup, small enough to fit into the palm of your
hand. The ribbon is as long as your arm, wide as
a little finger and woven of actual gold threads
[30 gp]. The cup has a looped handle and a battered,
well used look [tin, 5 sp]. Within the cup
is a small gold ring, narrow and quite plain [20
gp] and two coins [1 gp and an antique silver piece,
3 sp to a trader]. [Total 101.6 gp]
53 A plain wooden chest [2 gp] sits gloomily on its
side. Where once was undoubtedly a lock, now a
jagged splintered hole, and long, ragged claw
marks mar the chest’s curved lid. Inside the chest
in a jumbled disarray are several bolts of dusty
canvas [4 bolts, 1 gp each], filthy, but still in reasonably
good condition. As you remove the canvas
from the chest you find a small bright object
caught in the weave of one bolt. It is a jagged
piece of coral, as long as a person’s finger [93 gp].
It should be large enough to for a jeweler to produce
a small pendant, or a couple pieces for
rings, if one can be found who knows how to
handle the material. [Total 99 gp]
54 In the sack, under linen shirts [8 shirts; 2 sp each]
and heavy wool pants [6 pairs; 3 sp each] lies a
dagger [17 gp] in a sheath [70 gp]. The sheath is
fine deep brown leather, sewn with invisible
stitches. All over its surface a master has tooled
leaves and flowers. Peering out from the shrubbery
on the sheath are small comic figures,
capering [leaping] and making faces. Along the
sheath carefully inset so they do not catch on
things, are several [4] green, lentil-sized stones
[malachite]. In the tooled design, the stones
appear as fruit on the plants. The well-balanced
dagger has a hilt wrapped in silver-colored wire,
with a large bluish gem [blue quartz] on the pommel.
A long black velvet ribbon [2 sp] and several
worn coins [9 gp, 5 sp, 6 cp] are loose on the
sack’s bottom. [Total 100.16 gp]
30
table III: 100 gold pieces
31
55 An enormous wooden crate [4 gp] is rather
empty, holding only two packages wrapped in
gray wool, and a shield. A heavy iron and oak
shield [12 gp] rests against the side of the crate.
The shield has seen years of hard service and is
covered in cracks and scars, and has obviously
been repaired numerous times. Dried blood
crusts the shield’s inner surface, and upon its
face you can faintly make out the fading image
of two black ships against a red background. A
clean gray woolen blanket [3 gp] wraps around a
single bolt of intricately dyed silk [5 yards, 50
gp], as tall as a young child and emblazoned with
a pastel floral print. Another blanket [3 gp] protects
a large roll of paper [48 pages, 4 sp each]. In
the bottom of the crate, a leather bag the size of
an apricot holds some gold dust [9 gp]. [Total
100.2 gp]
56 A large wicker basket [6 sp] has been tied shut
with a length of high quality hemp twine.
Untying the bundle, you discover an assortment
of mouthwateringly fresh fruit [2 sp]. Beneath
the fruit you discover a neatly folded set of
jester’s clothes. The multicolored silk shirt and
pants are obviously high quality, and decorated
with flashing shards of rose quartz, silk tassels,
and small golden bells [55 gp]. A pair of blacklacquered
bamboo flutes, inlaid with silver [12
gp each] rest between the shirt and pants. A set
of four silver drinking cups [5 gp each], each just
the right size to take a shot of whiskey, rest nested
within one another. Each shot glass has a
large gold coin from a far away land inset into its
base as an unusual decoration. [Total 99.8 gp]
57 A dusty flour sack [5 cp] is stuffed to the point of
ripping with treasure and food. A dozen fat potatoes
overgrown with pale sprouts [4 cp] give the
sack a rich, earthy scent. Tossing the potatoes
aside, you discover a battered warhammer [8 gp]
crusted with old blood and dried hair; its handle
notched with nearly a hundred victory marks. A
bronze discus [2 gp] decorated by a meander pattern
notched into the metal shares the sack with
the hammer. A steel closed helmet with a furious
boar’s head faceplate [8 gp], though tarnished
and dull, remains clearly valuable. A
leather fetish bag decorated with colorful beads
and feathers [2 sp] contains the true treasure. A
single square cut peridot, the size of a finger
joint, gleams within the leather bag [74 gp]. A
few coins round out this collection [8 gp]. [Total
100.29 gp]
58 Treasure has been stuffed into a huge wrought
iron cauldron [22 gp] big enough to easily cook a
whole pig and as heavy as a castle’s foundation
stone. Four short swords [8 gp each] of standard
‘infantry’ make, completely free from ornamentation,
have been tossed into the cauldron, as
have a half dozen iron-tipped shortspears [1 gp
each] of similarly plain design. A pile of more
than 20 simple cloth tunics, all of which are
peasant shirts in varying shades of brown and
crimson, have been tossed atop the weapons [5
cp each]. Though the shirts are old, and patched
multiple times, they are clean and in pretty good
condition. Lying loose in the bottom of the cauldron
are a few slivers of blue and purple lapis
lazuli [6 pieces, 4 gp each] and the contents of a
leather bag [1 gp] which has come open and
spilled its silver and copper coins [70 sp, 600 cp].
[Total 99 gp]
59 A battered violin [25 gp] leans against the wall,
its strings broken and a hole ruining the graceful
lines of its lower bout. The violin is otherwise of
expert craftsmanship, with subtly worked lines
and tightly fitted pieces of exotic woods. The
scroll of the instrument is carved in the shape of
three stylized feathers. The hole is wide enough
for a slender woman’s hand to reach into, and
inside are five, small silver vials [75 gp]. Once
the vials are removed from the violin you can
see they are each wrought like pixies in various
states and poses. One vial is fashioned to look
like a shy, demure pixie, with wings folded to
partially obscure its face and contains violet ink.
The second vial looks like a courageous pixie
wielding a tiny spear and holds red ink. One
shaped like a wild pixie, with leaves and vines
tangled in its long hair naturally contains green
ink. The forth looks like a pixie in a meditative
pose and holds black ink; blue ink is found in
the final vial which depicts a pixie with its face
tilted up to admire the moon. [Total 100 gp]
60 A badly cracked and sun-faded wine jar [2 sp]
sits off in a dusty corner of the room [wagon, lair,
etc.]. The pale brown and amber stone jar stands
as high as a man’s waist, and weighs nearly as
much as that same man. A handful of copper
coins [6 cp] lie forgotten in the dust [dirt] around
the huge jug. Lifting the jug’s lid, you discover a
sea of copper; the jug is filled to the brim with
low value coins of a hundred nations and trading
guilds! When the jug is upended, its contents
spill out onto the floor in a clattering
wave. Sifting through the various coins, you see
they are mostly copper with a handful of silver
coins speckling the mix [70 sp, 8400 cp]. Among
the coins is a single malachite earring, missing
its backing post, and small enough to rest comfortably
on the tip of a woman’s nail [10 gp].
[Total 101.26 gp]
the mother of all treasure tables

61 There is a square wooden box with metal corners
[6 sp], closed with a latch. Inside you find a belt
long enough to go around a large human man
made of plain hammered links of silver metal,
each just smaller than a halfling’s hand and
shaped as a rough square with rounded corners.
The links hook to each other, so there is no
buckle [silver, 30 gp]. A wooden comb and carefully
made, matching wooden brush [set, 2 gp] lie
next to a knitted green wool hat [3 cp]. Filling
one corner of the box is a corked copper bottle
[2 gp]. In it is a thick oily liquid [lamp oil, 1 sp].
Loose in the bottom of the box are 16 darts [5 sp
each], painted black, and under them are two
small pouches [3 sp each]. The first holds a
bronze brooch [50 gp] set with four small bluegreen
gems [turquoise]. The second holds several
coins [7 gp, 14 sp, 3 cp]. [Total 101.76 gp]
62 Inside a large steel footlocker [15 gp], stamped
with the hound and hare insignia of a famed
mercenary company, you uncover a well-oiled
black leather military saddle [23 gp] with gleaming
tin stirrups. Reliefs of sharks and schools of
fish decorate the stirrups and metal pommel. A
rough iron longsword [15 gp] lies under the saddle,
and its square hilt is decorated with similar
motifs. A roughly hexagonal heavy steel shield
[20 gp] completes the outfit, and has been decorated
with black enamel dolphins and an octopus.
A pair of leather riding gloves, stitched with
green spirals at the knuckles [3 gp] has been
tossed into the bottom of the case. One of the
gloves is stuffed with copper coins from various
countries [487 cp], a single silver coin, and a
heavy silver ring decorated with zigzag cutouts
[18 gp]. [Total 98.87 gp]
63 Stuffed into a sturdy canvas sack [3 sp], you find
a set of green and blue-studded leather barding
[68 gp] complete with an iron bridle decorated
with yellow ribbons [2 sp]. The fanciful barding
has been carved with swirling, serpentine dragons
curled around globes or the points of spears.
Deeper inside the sack, you find a pair of ornate
bracers carved from red wood and reinforced
with textured iron bands which wind around the
bracelets like vipers [8 gp]. In a scabbard
attached to the barding, you find a gently curved
dagger with an elaborate bronze handle [4 gp]. A
fine pair of plain black wool breeches [1 gp], a
lightweight green and white wool dress [2 gp],
and a red and brown loincloth of woven wool [5
cp] are all wadded beneath the barding. A green
drawstring bag [1 sp] holds a collection of copper
coins [120 cp], a knuckle-sized opal [15 gp], and
a single gold coin shaped like a tiny shield [1 gp].
[Total 100.85 gp]
64 A polished bone jewelry case inlaid with a golden
knot motif would fit in a petite woman’s outstretched
hands [25 gp]. The clever latch opens
with a soft click, revealing the case’s gleaming
contents. A necklace of tiny seed pearls [64 gp]
rests on the pink velvet lining. Its center pendant
is a mother of pearl circle inscribed with a
good-luck symbol. Beneath the necklace, you
discover a pair of simple silver loop earrings [10
gp], affixed to the case by small bronze hooks.
Four small gold half-coins rest at the bottom of
the case. The coins have been carved to resemble
the rising sun: they are simple half circles
decorated with raylike lines radiating out from a
central point [2 gp]. [Total 101 gp]
65 You open the sack [1 gp] to find six heavy brass
bowls with animal figures etched on the sides [2
gp each] and four tall brass mugs, each with blue
rings of enamel swirling around the sides and up
the handles [4 gp each]. Several coins [2 gp, 3 sp,
6 cp] and a small round red stone [carnelian, 40
gp] are in the bottom of one mug. Four spoons lie
under the cups. Three are large, of gray metal,
with an attractive bird carved in the handle
design [pewter, 5 sp each], the other is small, fine
and light, the handle elaborately crafted with
entwining vines [silver, 4 gp]. Below them lies a
dagger in a sheath. The dagger is plain and
rather broad, hammered of fine iron [2 gp]. The
sheath is worked leather, pale brown, with a
large yellowish stone dominating its surface
[tigereye, 20 gp; sheath 2 gp]. [Total 100.86 gp]
66 You find a pine chest whose walls have been
carved with a hunting scene depicting noblemen
hunting bears and wild boars [15 gp]. The chest
is secured with a sturdy copper lock. It contains
a trio of hand axes whose wooden handles have
been wrapped with deep crimson ribbons [6 gp
each]. A soapstone wine jug [32 gp] shaped like a
gleaming green dragon has been wrapped in cotton
batting to protect it, and a single agate [4 gp
value] rattles around inside the jug. A small silver
whistle designed to resemble a hummingbird
[13 gp] can be found tangled up in the cotton
batting protecting the wine jug. A dozen crusty
gold nuggets, each approximately the size of a
pea, are rolled up in a piece of waxed butcher’s
paper [worth 17 gp total] and stuffed towards the
rear of the chest. [Total 99 gp]
67 Climbing gear has been stuffed into a broken ale
cask, and coils of strong hemp rope [50 feet, 1 gp]
slip out from where a board is missing. A pair of
long-handled oak and iron picks protrudes from
the top of the cask [4 gp each] as do two sturdy
pine poles [tent poles]. Two wineskins with
swirling star patterns done in beads [4 gp each]
dangle from one pole. One is dry and empty; the
other is full of something, which smells like fermented
goat’s milk [2 cp]. To the other pole is
table III: 100 gold pieces
33
tied a purse of off-white, tightly-woven wool [1
sp] which holds an assortment of copper and silver
coins [57 sp, 48 cp] and a deep red, crescentcut
bloodstone [58 gp]. Coiled alongside the
pine poles are three longhide whips [1 gp each]
each tipped with a copper claw at the end of the
handle. A bright orange and yellow wool blanket
[5 sp] wraps an equally colorful single-person
tent [12 gp]. In the bottom is a strong canvas
backpack, full of climbing pitons with symbols
of protection engraved on their heads [40 pitons,
20 pounds total; 1 sp each]. [Total 100.80 gp]
68 Two huge amphora [storage jars; 7 gp each] with
bulbous bases and long slender necks stand side
by side. They each come to about a man’s waist
and have identical decoration: climbing lattice
patterns in blue and white encircling the base.
The vases’ necks have been textured with rough
raised dots; both are sealed with dark purple
wax. [If opened:] One amphora holds low-quality
red wine [15 gallons, 4 gp]. The other amphora
is filled with pounds of dried dates, raisins and
chestnuts [24 gp]. [If the adventurers investigate
further:] Amid the food, you discover a goldenbladed
ceremonial gladius [short sword; gilded
steel, 44 gp] in an ornately decorated leather and
gold scabbard [15 gp]. The sword looks virtually
useless for battle, but may be valuable as an art
object. Both sword and scabbard are decorated
with scenes that seem to be from a boy’s coming
of age ceremony. [101 gp]
69 A silver pitcher sits [45 gp] upended in a large
silver chamber pot [55 gp]. The pitcher is decorated
lavishly, if not a bit gaudily, with raised
depictions of frolicking satyrs, centaurs and
other various fey kicking up their heels and feeding
each other grapes and other delicacies. The
mouth of the pitcher is a horse’s snout, opened
wide as if captured in a perpetual whinny. The
chamber pot is quite large in diameter and decorated
with the grinning face of a minotaur,
right eye winking cheekily. Layers of thick dust
coat both pieces, and a dried, powdery layer of
some dark substance remains at the bottom of
the chamber pot. [If the adventurers turn over the
pitcher or chamber pot, they would see etched in the
metal what must have been the artist’s signature,
now illegible through years of wear.] [Total 100 gp]
70 Inside a set of heavy, finely stitched leather saddlebags
[10 gp], you discover nine small glass
vials [5 gp each]. Each vial previously contained
a different rare and valuable spice, from common
spices like salt and cinnamon to far more
exotic flavors. The leaded-glass vials are hand
blown, and a small papyrus tag dangles from
each stopper. The tags describe the former contents
and are hand lettered in the common
tongue with a small, neat, feminine script. In
another of the saddlebag’s many pouches, you
discover more than a dozen badly tarnished silver
spoons and table knives [set, 45 gp]. Each of
the utensils has a long handle, the head of
which has been carved to resemble a different
exotic animal. Though years of soot and tarnish
obscure the details the skill of the artist is apparent;
the spoon with a giraffe’s head is particularly
well sculpted and lifelike. [Total 100 gp]
71 Wrapped in a large square of supple dark green
leather [1 gp], you uncover a life-sized wooden
owl. The owl is carved out of a single piece of
wood, deep red in color, and in place of eyes it
has a pair of matching tiger’s eyes. The feathers
are exquisitely carved, and their edges have
been picked out with inlaid silver. The owl’s
talons are made of silver, and it looks as though
it was designed to be mounted on a perch. [The
whole owl is worth 70 gp; the tiger’s eyes are 15 gp
each on their own.] A heavy pouch is tied to one
of its legs with a piece of silken cord. Inside the
pouch are a mouse carved out of red-streaked
marble [4 gp], three thumb-sized gold ingots,
each stamped with the number “6” [6 gp each]
and a few coins [6 gp, 20 sp]. [Total 101 gp]
72 A noble’s fine cloak [7 gp] has been used to wrap
up a number of small items, and this improvised
bag is held closed with a length of leather cord.
The cloak is inside out, with its pale-green silk
lining showing; unwrapping it, you see the
reverse is pale red in color. Inside the cloak is a
hunting horn [1 gp], a small comb elaborately
carved from a deer’s antler [14 gp], a bulls-eye
lantern [12 gp], and three small clay jugs. All
three jugs smell as though they once held reasonably
good wine, but they have been put to
other uses. The first is filled with dried grass;
emptying it out, you find three oddly shaped
pearls [12 gp each] among the grass. Uncorking
the second jug, you find it to be full of silver
coins [100 sp]. The third jug holds a thick, viscous
paste smelling vaguely of brimstone
[alchemist’s fire, 20 gp]. [Total 100 gp]
73 In a wooden coffin [4 gp], strangely bereft of a
body, you find a large lace kerchief [1 gp] covering
several items. Oddly, as you lift the kerchief
you notice the items are surrounded by silver
pieces. The coins are arranged to form a crude
triangle [90 sp]. Inside the triangle of coins you
find a lock pick made of silver [4 gp], a small
golden padlock that looks as if it were meant to
be worn hanging from a necklace [31 gp], and a
carved brown crystal feather. The intricate detail
of this item is amazing, and it is flawless, showing
the mother of all treasure tables
34
no sign of damage or wear [made of smoky quartz,
– the color will fade to clear if exposed to the sun for
an extended period of time, 51 gp]. [Total 100 gp]
74 Opening a white-painted wooden case [2 gp] you
discover a pair of gleaming, exceedingly sharp,
steel knives [surgical scalpels, 5 gp each], a tough
serrated saw [bone saw, 30 gp] and vicious steel
shears [designed to easily bite through ribs, 25 gp].
Beside the bladed equipment, you find a dark
leather wine skin filled with what smells like
perfumed water, and fitted with a long bronze
nozzle which resembles an ibis’ beak [enema bottle,
4 gp]. You also find five squat blue glass bottles
[1 gp each] filled with soothing ointments
[moisturizing lotions, 1 gp each], four poultices in
folded waxed paper [1 sp each], and yard upon
yard of thin fabric strips [linen bandages, 10 yards;
3 sp/yard] wrapped around a miniature steel scale
[4 gp]. Six tallow candles [1 cp each], 2 spools of
black and green thread [2 sp each], 2 heavy gauge
steel needles [5 sp each], three slivers of soap in
paper wrappers [5 cp each], and some woolen rags
[8, 1 cp each] round out the contents [surgeon’s
kit]. A few silver and gold coins [6 gp, 42 sp] are
kept in a buttoned pouch on the underside of the
case’s lid. [Total 100.29 gp]
75 You find a tightly woven brown bag with a thick
cotton drawstring [1 sp]. From inside you pull
out a man’s shirt, badly folded and quite wrinkled.
It is made of a finely woven material [linen]
and dyed sky blue. Down the front it has six buttons
made of a creamy white stone [mother of
pearl; shirt 40 gp]. Also in the bag is a pair of
white leather gloves, to fit large hands. They are
a consistent white color but unornamented [15
gp]. You also find a long brown, braided-leather
belt [2 gp] with a fine buckle as big as your fist,
shaped like a wolf’s head, howling [silver 15 gp].
At the bottom of the bag is a red leather pouch
[5 sp] bulging with coins [23 gp, 52 sp, 14 cp]
[Total 100.94 gp]
76 Within a wicker fruit basket [4 sp], you find five
matching jerkins [3 gp each], all made of heavy
kid leather. The leather tunics have been decorated
with wool bandings, dyed a pale, blotchy
yellow, which contrasts nicely with the soft
brown of the leather. On the sweat stained,
inside collar of each jerkin you can just make
out blurred writing, possibly the name of some
long-forgotten soldier. A pair of waxed paper
sacks is stuffed under the jerkins, each containing
a heavy ration of salt [2 pounds each, 10 gp
each]. Another similar sack contains a quantity
of a spicy yellow powder [saffron, 2 pounds; 30
gp]. A maroon ale mug of clay [2 cp] has been
wedged between the clothes, with a small brown
bag [2 cp] stuffed inside it. In it you find a set of
bronze house keys [4 cp], a heavy gold locket
shaped like a bee lighting on a flower [24 gp],
and mixed silver and copper coins [97 sp, 45 cp].
[Total 99.63 gp]
77 A knobby wooden butter churn [5 sp], large
enough to churn weeks of butter at once, has
been stuffed with valuables. A heavy wolf’s pelt
[9 gp] protrudes from the top. It is expertly
tanned and rolled into a tight bundle. Wrapped
in the center of it is an unsheathed scimitar [17
gp] whose curving blade has been acid etched
with floral designs. Also stashed in the pelt is an
angular onyx statuette [62 gp] depicting a stag
chewing the branches of a great tree.
Underneath the pelt, a lamp made of pinkishgrey
soapstone [5 gp] rests atop a leather purse.
Lifting the lamp, you hear the distinct sloshing
of lamp oil inside. The stained purse holds a
small store of coins [4 gp, 6 sp, 12 cp]. Iron keys
to various locks [worth 5 sp total] lie on the
churn’s greasy bottom. [Total 98.72 gp]
78 A large leather belt pouch [good condition, 1 gp]
feels full as you lift and open it. You spill the
contents out to find several shiny items. The
first thing to really catch your eye is a stunning
brooch. An oval piece of ivory is imbedded into
a silver setting. The ivory is intricately carved
with a floral design, and you can imagine it
being worn by a powdered and perfumed lady of
high station. On the back of the brooch there
were once initials engraved into the silver just
below the pin, but they have been worn down
and you cannot make them out [47 gp]. You sift
through several coins [18 gp, 18 sp, 31 cp] and
discover a strange, flat disc. It is about two
thumb widths in diameter and has symbols
etched on each side. On one side is the likeness
of a hawk in flight, and on the other side is a
snake, coiled and ready to strike [platinum disc,
31 gp]. [Total 99.11 gp]
79 An ornate tower shield [45 gp] lies on the
ground here. The oval bronze shield is decorated
by three spiral patterns, each accented by
teardrop-shaped pieces of smoked glass. A
weighty leather and iron helm [9 gp] with a pair
of thick horns rests nearby, its surface etched
with interlaced circle designs. Under the shield,
you find a longsword [31 gp] with a wavy blade
inlaid with silver to resemble scales. The sword’s
hilt is a leaping fish rendered in bronze. A small
purse covered in intricate braiding [3 gp] contains
a few pieces of salted pork and smoked fish
[3 sp], as well as a number of copper coins [57
cp], and a piece of grey-black hematite [11 gp].
[Total 99.87 gp]
table III: 100 gold pieces

80 A fishing net [3 gp], folded haphazardly, hangs
from a jagged piece of rock [metal, wood] jutting
from the wall. The net has undoubtedly been
there quite some time, and yet there are still
scraps of kelp and seaweed, now dried and black,
clinging to the sturdy ropes. Within the layers of
netting is tied a small, square box, no larger than
a halfling’s head. As you take the net down and
begin to search through its brine-scented tangles
you also discover a holy symbol [95 gp] wrought
of pure gold. The symbol is shaped like a small
shell, with a stylized outer border carved into
the shining metal. The interior of the shell may
have once contained lettering or a picture, but
the passing of time and hands has robbed the
symbol of any meaning. The small wooden box
[1 sp], once opened, reveals five large, steel fish
hooks [8 sp]. [Total 98.9 gp]
81 Inside a slightly mildewed sack [4 cp] you find
eight bracelets, each carefully wrapped in a
piece of soft cloth. Two are made of tarnished
silver wire, accented with copper, and they
appear to be a set [8 gp each]. Another is crafted
of copper with gold inlays, and set with six small
black stones [onyxes; 10 gp], while the fourth is a
plain bronze band etched with delicate carvings
of sparrows [18 gp]. The next three are all broken,
cut cleanly as if by a heavy blade. These
bracelets are broad bands of brass with scrollwork
around their edges [6 gp each]. The last is
the work of an exceptional craftsman, three
slender interlocked bands with a wave motif.
The foam on the crests of the waves is picked
out in tiny seed pearls, and a tiny three-masted
ship sits at the center of the design [38 gp]. [Total
100.04 gp]
82 A wisp of green tickles your vision from a niche
in the wall. Upon investigation you discover a
beautiful velvet mask [76 gp] colored the deep,
vibrant green of a woodland snake, and decorated
with peacock feathers and a dozen tiny irregular
[freshwater] pearls. The slender wooden
stick that holds the mask to one’s face is broken
off a mere finger’s length down. The mask is
padded with white silk, now stained with time
and neglect. The eyeholes are cut as if to appear
feline and cunning, the edges curving upward to
lend a catlike air to the wearer. Lying behind the
mask is a set of four wooden goblets and their
round, wooden serving tray [24 gp]. These items
are carved from pale, golden wood, painted with
a simple pattern of leaves. The stems of the goblets
are stained a deep green, as is the outer border
of the serving tray. [Total 100 gp]
83 A horse’s bit and bridle of worked iron with tiny
images of horses painted as decorations lie on
top of a box on a black and gray striped horse
blanket [wool, 10 gp]. The designs on the bit and
bridle are very well crafted and beautiful [3 gp].
A longsword [45 gp] in a black leather scabbard
[5 gp] lies under the blanket. It has white stones
[moonstones] in the pommel and a plain blade.
The sword belt is black leather matching the
scabbard. It closes with a silver buckle in the
form of a screaming eagle, a small moonstone as
its eye [buckle, 30 gp]. Opening the box a bright
red silk neck scarf is crumpled in one corner [3
feet by 4 inches, 4 gp] while under the scarf are
hidden several coins [2 gp, 2 sp, 28 cp]. [Total
99.48 gp]
84 A tattered and foul-smelling cloth sack is stuffed
to the brim with squalid treasures. Amid rotting
hunks of meat and smoked catfish you discover
a pair of silvered throwing knives, their wooden
handles carved with images of doves in flight [15
gp]. A tattered cloth that smells like a privy
encloses an elaborate bronze mace with a head
carved to resemble a couchant [reclining] bull [25
gp]. Several well-machined bronze gears from
some unknown contraption, each the size of a
piece of fruit, line the sack’s grimy bottom [5 gp
for the set]. A well-balanced broad-bladed sword
with a crescent moon design adorning the hilt
[56 gp] is stored within its decaying leather and
bronze scabbard. The scabbard once had an
intricate mosaic, possibly a battle scene decorating
its outer surface, but age and use have worn
away most of the small stones. [Total 101 gp]
85 An upturned rusted helmet is partially covered
with canvas [the helmet is rusted beyond repair and
is useless]. When you remove the fabric from the
helm you see it is host to several items. You discover
numerous coins [24 gp, 37 sp], a silver
choker necklace [26 gp], and a small box made of
polished platinum. The box is delicately crafted,
with a clasp to keep it closed. When you open
the box you see it is full of finely pulverized
tobacco. You also notice the initials W.K. etched
on the inside of the lid [snuff box worth 46 gp,
tobacco worth 5 sp]. [Total 100.2 gp]
86 You discover an intricately etched jewelry box
carved from large pieces of bone [16 gp], and decorated
by bas-relief carvings depicting the giant’s
death at the hands of a mounted knight with
lance and sword. Inside you find an apricot-sized
geode filled with pale violet crystals [9 gp], a butterfly
brooch carved from green-tinged copper [9
gp], and a gold signet ring with the embossed catapult
sigil of a military clan [6 gp]. You also find
an ivory hairbrush [15 gp] whose handle is
shaped like a plump, reclining woman; two
palm-length gold hatpins [4 gp each]; a silver
the mother of all treasure tables
hand mirror with its back carved like a bouquet
of roses and accented by red enamel [20 gp]; and
a perfumed white satin pouch containing gold
and silver coins [15 gp, 29 sp]. [Total 100.9 gp]
87 Here you see a portable ram [40 gp], carved of
solid mahogany and capped with a steel head
shaped like a bull. The horns of the bull are also
wood, and smaller than would exist in life. The
bull’s nostrils are pierced with small brass rings,
and the ram is equipped with two heavy steel
handles, one on each side. Nearby you spot
something gleaming from beneath thick layers
of cobwebs. It is a small silver hand mirror [60
gp], its pristine surface miraculously intact
despite the dirt. The ornate silver frame is fashioned
in the shape of a glowering beast, fangs
overlapping the looking surface, baleful eyes
staring at the observer with patient menace.
The handle of the mirror is shaped like a tail,
ending in a nub of metal shaped to resemble
curling fur. [Total 100 gp]
88 Inside an old wooden box [4 sp] you find a long
triangular lance head of black iron [8 gp], large
fur-lined leather mittens [2 gp], a blue and green
plaid wool scarf, which would go around a
halfling’s neck and to the ground on both sides
[5 sp], and two locks. The heavy but compact
iron locks are the type used to keep chests and
sheds safe. They appear to open to the same key,
but there is no key [70 gp together]. Lying loose
on the bottom of the box is a small pair of scissors
of silver metal with gilding partly chipped
off in the shape of a long-beaked bird [tin, 10 sp],
also a handful of coins [5 gp, 12 sp, 8 cp] and a
small red leather box [3 gp]. Inside it you find a
set of wooden cards, designs painted on one side
in great detail [tarot or other fortune-telling cards,
10 gp]. [Total 101.18 gp]
89 A pile of dried, blackened turnip tops almost
completely obscures a large pot [35 gp]. After the
pot is pulled free of the refuse it becomes apparent
that it was once a favored item of a chef.
Made of hammered copper, the pot is deep
enough to fit several gallons of stew, and wide
enough for a halfling to sit in with his knees by
his ears. The rim of the pot is thick but dented
in a few places. The handles are covered with
white porcelain and decorated with patterns of
ornate black paisleys and florals. When the pot’s
flat, copper lid is removed, a small flute [65 gp]
can be found inside. The flute is carved of
mahogany and has a small amount of ivory inlay
decorating it. Its tone is somewhat muffled. [The
instrument will play clear, pure notes, once a carefully
folded scrap of paper is removed from its pipe.
The paper has the notes of a song written upon it.]
[Total 100 gp]
90 A large sack sits in the corner, obviously full [1
sp]. As you pull the string to open the sack you
can hear the clanging noises of metal on metal.
Inside you find an unbelievable amount of jewelry.
There are at least a hundred pieces of mixed
trinkets, including necklaces, rings, bracelets,
and earrings. Taking the time to sort through
the bag you discover most of its contents are
simple costume jewelry [105 assorted pieces of
cheap jewelry, 35 gp]. However, several pieces
catch your eye. You find a simple thin gold necklace
that looks authentic [32 gp], an old worn silvery
coin [1 pp], and a silver ring set with small
green stone tourmalines [24 gp]. [It is a common
legend that jewelry made from tourmaline will protect
the wearer against many dangers and misfortunes;
this, however, has no magical properties.]
[Total 101.1 gp]
91 In a footed black iron caldron large enough to
boil half a cow [80 gp] you find a hand axe
[throwing axe, 8 gp], small and streamlined, the
iron blade highly polished and wrapped in wool
rags. On the bottom of the caldron are small
cloth bags containing wheat [whole, 10 pounds,
5 sp], rice [whole, 5 pounds, 2 sp], and dried
leaves [sage for seasoning, 5 cp] and a wooden
spoon [2 cp]. In a small leather pouch is a metal
box painted all over with brightly colored stylized
animals [tin, 3 gp] and a few coins [5 gp 2 sp].
Inside the box is a set of six-sided dice made of
bone [3 gp]. Ten rocks about the size of your fist
are in the bottom of the cauldron. Some are
white; others are brown and black. [Heat the
stones and put them into water to boil it; 1 sp total.]
[Total 100.07 gp]
92 You find a backpack [1 gp] made of dyed green
leather. The blackened corners of the pack shine
with the strain of use, and several seams look
quite frayed, but the bag is otherwise in good
condition. It is sized for a man of medium stature
to carry comfortably. Tasseled braids tie the pack
shut, and once these are loosened the smell of
old, rotten cheese emanates from the bag. A
half-eaten rind of moldy, blue-green cheese tumbles
out as you upend the bag. The backpack
also contains an exquisitely fashioned hourglass
[55 gp], wrought of pale pewter. The top of the
hourglass is shaped like two folded birds’ wings,
while the base of the device is decorated by
three graduated rings. The sand within the glass
chambers is dyed a deep crimson color. You also
find a thunderstone [30 gp], one platinum piece
and three gold pieces in the bottom of the backpack.
[Total 99 gp]
93 An unsealed barrel [2 gp] is overturned, its open
end facing the wall. When you turn it around
36
table III: 100 gold pieces
you find a light crossbow [35 gp] inside. Its lever
is painted black, while the body of the weapon
is fashioned of a deep russet-hued wood. There
are no nicks or scrapes marring the wood of the
weapon, as if it has never been used. If you
remove the crossbow you find just beyond it a
water stained piece of paper wrapped around a
string of five tiger’s eye beads [52 gp] on a black
silk cord [1 sp]. Each bead is carved in the shape
of a small fang, about the size of a common dog’s.
The silk cord is tied in four knots on one end
and five knots on the other. The paper appears
to have writing on it, but the words have been
marred by dampness and mold, rendering them
illegible. Behind the paper lies a single platinum
piece [1 pp]. [Total 99.1 gp]
94 You find a small dark canvas backpack closed
with a pair of buckles [useable, 2 gp]. Rolled in it
are two common cream-colored blouses that
would fit a small woman [cotton, 5 cp each], a
short sleeved filmy red blouse of the same size
with embroidered red flowers across the front
[silk, 11 gp], two plain dark skirts [cotton, 1 sp
each] and a much finer skirt of black [wool-silk,
10 gp]. Further in the backpack are three pairs of
dark socks [cotton, 5 cp each], a set of stockings
[silk, 10 gp] and fine leather shoes, rather worn
[10 gp]. In the corner of the pack is a tattered
brown leather pouch with drawstrings of leather
[5 sp]. The pouch is filled with coins [9 gp, 27 sp,
12 cp] and on the bottom is a finely made gray
necklace [silver] with a pair of black stones
[obsidian; necklace 46 gp]. [Total 101.77 gp]
95 Two unlikely items share a forgotten bit of floor
in the corner: a long, thick staff of ebony [45 gp]
lies alongside an enormous leg-hold trap [55 gp].
The trap has only the faintest beginnings of rust
on its steel frame, and is shaped like a closed,
toothy maw, easily the length of a small woman’s
height. The trap’s frame is made deadly with two
single rows of sharp, blade-like teeth, wrought
from steel and shaped like large spear tips. The
size of the trap suggests it could make quick work
of a dire bear, trapping the creature’s huge leg in
its grip until a hunter can come along and deal
the killing blow. The long staff of ebony wood is
a curious item. A man of modest stature would
need both hands to encircle the staff, and the
only markings etched into the wood are near the
two ends. At one end a stylized depiction of the
sun is carved, and at the other depictions of
thunder and rain decorate the staff. When it is
turned end over end, a soothing, hissing sound
emanates from the staff, as if hundreds of pieces
of grain, or seeds, were trapped inside to imitate
the sound of falling rain. [Total 100 gp]
96 The large wooden chest crumbles and falls apart
as you open it, the wood having rotted over
years of sitting in this place [latch and hinges are
still useable, 2 sp]. As you sort through the old
wood and dust you first discover a leather tunic.
This sleeveless piece of clothing is of such thin
leather that it would provide no protection
against attack, but it is decorated nicely and in
good condition [13 gp]. As you begin to lift the
tunic you can tell something is stored within it.
You reach into it and recover a hinged metal
box about a hand wide, a finger tall, and a palm
deep [no lock, 8 gp]. You open the box and see
several coins [14 gp, 11 sp], and as you push
them around you spot a small figurine fashioned
from gold [2.5 inches tall]. The sculpture is of an
elf maiden sitting on her knees, looking down as
if in meditation [pure gold statuette, 62 gp]. [Total
98.30 gp]
97 You find a wooden box about the size of a loaf of
bread, its hinges and clasp made of silver [8 gp].
A battle scene is carved on the lid [perhaps a
famous conflict from your campaign], and the box
has no lock. The inside of the box is lined with
threadbare purple velvet and contains a small
green silk bag, an ornate brass candle snuffer and
a pair of matching sheathed daggers. The candlesnuffer
has a slender, tapering handle, and
the bell on its end is carved into the shape of a
horned demon’s head [or other mythical beast; 5
gp]. The two daggers are as long as a child’s forearm,
with oak handles wrapped in silver wire;
their sheaths are of unadorned black leather [4
gp each]. Inside the silk bag [1 sp], you find four
pea-sized purple gems with obvious flaws
[amethysts; 13 gp each] and some mixed coinage
[2 pp, 4 gp, 30 sp]. [Total 100.1 gp]
98 A mildewed wooden sea chest with flaking yellow
paint and rope handles [1 gp] opens to reveal
a fine suit of courtier’s finery [31 gp]. The heavy
overcoat is an almost-black red satin trimmed
with violet piping, and cut in a military style.
Row upon row of medals and ribbons [5 gp total]
fill both breasts, and gold rank insignia [5 gp]
adorns the high collar. A pair of dark wool
trousers and a well-made white shirt completes
the uniform. Under the neatly folded clothing,
you find a small silver locket hung from a red
silk cord. It is shaped like an hourglass with
excellent [if tiny] charcoal sketches of a handsome
couple inside [20 gp]. A light mace with a
gleaming steel head shaped like a cut diamond
[6 gp] lies at the bottom of the sea chest. Beside
the mace are two bundles of tightly wrapped
cloth [1 sp each], one holding a ration of salt [1
pound, 5 gp], the other containing part of a
pound of cloves [2/3 pound, 10 gp; or the bundle
37
the mother of all treasure tables
38
could contain a sample of verdant green cannabis].
Scattered around the floor of the chest are gold
and silver coins from a dozen ports of call [14 gp,
18 sp]. [Total 99 gp]
99 You find a brigandine vest [65 gp]. An unusual
piece of armor, the vest is constructed of small
steel plates – each about four coins in length and
a coin and a half in height – riveted to a thick
textile covering. There are thick leather straps
on the sides and over the shoulders to enable the
wearer to adjust the fit. The more than two hundred
small steel plates are in turn covered with
burgundy-hued velvet, although this has faded
and grown bare with time and use. The vest is
sized for a man of medium stature to wear, and is
surprisingly light for its materials. It is also
extremely flexible. Once you lift the vest from
the floor you find a second item of value beneath
it: a silver drawer pull [35 gp]. The drawer pull is
cunningly designed to look like a birch branch,
and one side of the item is covered in tiny, intricately
fashioned leaves. [Total 100 gp]
100 A dusty felt purse [1 sp] with colorful red, white
and blue zigzag patterns stitched into the brown
cloth contains surprising riches. A small cast
iron skillet [5 sp] rests in the main compartment.
Along side it are a wooden mallet [3 sp] and a
pick. The pick is heavy bronze [8 gp] with similar
zigzag patterns rendered in obsidian on its
handle. Other compartments contain rolled
parchment, writing implements [4 sp], and a
tube of dried ink [useless]. Most of the parchment
is covered with surveying data and mining
details, but a good amount of the paper is still
usable [8 pages, 16 sp]. Useful necessities like 4
pieces of soap, chalk, three whetstones, flint and
steel, and a needle and thread [1 gp total] fill
other compartments. Hidden pockets inside the
purse reveal an impressive collection of gold
nuggets [90 gp]. [Total 101.9 gp]
table III: 100 gold pieces

What are these nifty things?
All sets are valued at 500 gold pieces plus or minus 2%,
or in other words 490 to 510 gp. The italicized text contains
values and information reserved for the game master. In
general, the GM will not immediately read this text to the
players; it is there for the GM to use as he or she sees fit.
Roll d% and use the indicated set:
01 Your foot strikes something hard with a thud.
[Upon examining the area, the characters find a hole
in the floor/ground.] You discover a round metal
lid about 2 feet wide that sits, recessed into the
floor. A handle in the center allows you to lift
the heavy lid from its resting place. Inside you
find a hole filled with coins, perhaps more coins
than you can carry fill the knee deep hole [72 gp,
582 sp, 13,578 cp]. In the midst of all the coins
you come across something, sitting at the bottom
of the hole. A statuette of pure platinum
forged in the likeness of a magnificent warhorse
rests in your hands. It is about five inches high
and six inches long, and very heavy for its size.
The detail of the horse and its barding is amazing,
its worth and significance to the person who
had it created is unfathomable [242 gp]. [Total
507.98 gp]
02 In the chest [2 gp] you find a cloak of heavy
brown leather [50 gp] lined with wool, the collar
and edges are trimmed in fox fur. It can be worn
by almost any human, though it fits only middle-
sized ones well. Beside it is a well-crafted
dagger [115 gp] with a deep green gem [spinel] in
the pommel, housed in a brown leather sheath
[2 gp]. There is a sleek highly polished wood box
[teak or other expensive wood, 50 gp]. Inside you
find, carefully packed, four crystal glasses decorated
with silver vines [25 gp each]. Under those
are two bolts of cloth, one fine yellow wool [10
yards, 20 gp] the other white silk [8 yards, 80 gp].
Set along the edge is a short green-glazed jar
with a broad mouth, lid closed and sealed with
wax [5 sp]. It is half-filled with honey, mostly
crystallized [1 pound, 2 sp] A plate, larger than a
man’s spread hand and apparently made of pure
gold, lies on its side behind the jar. It is very thin
and so also light [45 gp]. Also along the wooden
bottom of the chest is an empty green-enameled
bottle [2 gp], a toy dog carved of wood [cute but
crude, 5 cp] and a sack of coins [26 gp, 74 sp, 119
cp]. [Total 501.34 gp]
03 You find a canvas sack [1 sp] holding two items.
The first is a flat, rectangular wooden box [2 gp],
which is closed with a hasp but not locked.
Inside, the box is lined with green velvet and
contains a set of steel cutlery with knives, forks,
spoons and serving spoons, six of each. The handles
are inlaid with mother of pearl and the
blades of the knives bear the hallmark of a wellknown
steel foundry [cutlery, 300 gp]. Tucked
into one side of the box is a green leather bag [2
gp] and inside it is a silver pot of ink. The ink is
still usable and the pot is inscribed with images
of fern leaves [75 gp]. As well as the inkpot, the
bag contains a tiny set of weighing scales made
from brass and suitable for measuring the
weights of spices [25 gp]. The second item in the
canvas sack is a box made from walnut wood
with a tiny statue of a fairy on top. [This is a
music box, and the statue rotates as the clockwork
mechanism plays a pretty tune; total 100 gp]. [Total
504.1 gp]
04 On a dainty, mirrored vanity table [156 gp] you
find several items. Seven small bottles of perfume
are lined up against the back of the table,
each one a different sickly sweet floral scent.
[Each bottle is worth 1 gp; the perfume inside each
bottle is worth 8 gp.] A comb and brush set sits [3
brushes and 3 combs – the set is worth 33 gp],
arranged by size, right in front of the mirror. The
items are made of some type of dark wood with
tan lines running through it. The bristles on the
brushes seem to be made of small, soft quills. A
small metal container with a lid [2 gp] sits to the
right of the brush set. It is filled with white talc
[13 gp], probably meant to be used as a powder
for the skin. A letter opener [89 gp] sits to the
left of the brushes. It is made of pure gold and
the end is carved to depict the head of a beautiful
elven lady. You open the small drawer at the
front of the vanity to find a pile of loose gold
pieces [46 gp] and a set of dyes. Apparently used
to dye your hair a different color, each of the 4
dyes is in a glass container with a cork and silver
clasp to seal the dye in tight [containers, 1 gp
each; hair dyes, 22 gp each; colors are red, black,
silver and brown]. [Total 494 gp]
05 The horsecart [15 gp] stands, fully loaded with
three large casks [2 gp each] and four huge baskets
[4 sp each]. The baskets are all filled to the
top with bread, loaves and loaves of bread.
Unfortunately, it has been here for days and all
Table IV:
500 Gold Pieces
40
of it is rock hard and worthless. The casks are
more promising. Opening one releases the heady
aroma of a rich red wine. All three of the casks
prove to be full of the same stuff. [Should a character
taste the wine, they find it to be slightly better
than average; 75 gp per cask]. Sitting among the
casks are two elegant steel goblets, presumably
for testing the stock [4 gp each] Resting near the
front of the cart is a bit and bridle that, while
used, is still in excellent condition [2 gp]. Tucked
under one of the bread baskets is a slim case
made of leather with a wooden handle [1 gp].
This opens to reveal an outfit made of fine blue
silk which is decorated with small, irregular
white stones [freshwater pearls; high-quality entertainer’s
outfit, 75 gp]. A sealed compartment in
the case holds coins, a mix of gold and silver
[136 gp, 340 sp]. [Total 503.6 gp]
06 A bundle of beaver fur is wrapped around something
to protect it. Unwrapping it, you see the
fur appears to be a cape [30 gp]. Within it there
is a suit of leather armor [10 gp], a beaver-fur cap
[15 gp], 2 daggers [2 gp each], four small traps [3
gp each], a pouch [1 gp], a leather backpack [2
gp], and a small bag [1 sp]. In the pouch you find
two very sharp skinning knives [2 gp each] and a
well-maintained leather scraper [5 sp]. In the
sack, wrapped in a scrap of green cloth [2 cp], is
a small gold chain bracelet [55 gp]. An even
tinier pouch [1 sp] holds five small rock crystals
which scintillate beautifully in the light [21 gp
each]. In the backpack, you find five tanned fox
skins [35 gp each], six tanned rabbit skins [3 gp
each], and another bag with a few hundred coins
[60 gp, 100 sp, 400 cp]. [Total 505.72 gp]
table IV: 500 gold pieces
41
07 Stuffed into what appears to be the skull of a
stone giant [20 gp], you find a small cache of
peculiar treasures: a crudely carved wooden
bracelet [250 gp] set with a massive piece of
amber, which is sized for a giant, the head of a
human-sized warhammer [70 gp] made of steel
with gold accents and a small piece of jade set
into one side, a sack of coins mixed with smooth
river pebbles [9 gp, 70 sp, 300 cp] and a buckler
[20 gp] with a tooled bronze rim. A bloody
giant’s head is painted on the front of the buckler,
and the inside surface is spattered with dried
blood. Sitting next to the giant’s skull are three
clay jugs of reddish wine, bound together with
buckled leather straps [rare dwarven fungus-wine,
25 gp per jug]. Resting against the jugs are two
heavy picks [8 gp each] and a long-handled
warhammer [30 gp]. The hammer’s handle is
made of dark wood banded with strips of iron,
and a design of crossed mining picks is stamped
on both sides of its head. A mosaic depicting the
twisting tunnels of a dwarfhold is picked out in
chips of obsidian on the flat top of the hammer’s
head. [Total 500 gp]
08 There is a display cabinet [40 gp] on one wall,
comprised of two wooden shelves protected by a
glass and wooden doors which open in the center.
Along both shelves are rows of crockery.
The top row of plates [6 plates, 12 gp each] is
rimmed in gold and painted with colorful farmyard
scenes. One bears a family of quacking
ducks, another a friendly looking bear eating a
bowl of porridge, a third has a pair of pigs
singing, a fourth a cat in a hat, the fifth has four
dogs playing a game of cards and the last one has
a laughing cow [72 gp total]. The bottom shelf
holds a dozen slightly smaller but heavier plates
[20 gp each] decorated with a dark green and gold
pattern around the edges and a small pink rose
design in the center. However, the most precious
item is a cream pitcher [140 gp] covered
with gold leaf, slightly speckled where it has
been worn in spots. Underneath the leaf it
shows that it is solid silver. [492 gp total]
09 Several mysterious items have been wrapped
tightly in a woman’s white linen shift. First
among these is a badly tangled necklace [149 gp]
that is the grey and fiery red of smoldering charcoal.
It is made from polished irregular chips of
hematite and rhodochrosite. A delicate tiara of
silver [63 gp], set with a clear blue quartz and
decorated with black ribbon, is pressed into the
cloth. A beaded choker [bone and iron, 30 gp] in
a pattern of tiny, staggered black and white, triangular
beads lies within the tiara. You find a
wooden statue [possibly a religious icon; 15 gp],
carved to fit into the palm of a hand, of an amazingly
detailed owl with human hands. Beside it
is a pair of obsidian arrowheads [50 gp], etched
with symbols and tied together with golden
thread. A lightweight red wool cloak [5 gp]
sports a small platinum broach [60 gp] of a
woman in a long dress holding a cup. A short
steel mace [68 gp] with the bronze head of a
snarling dog is wrapped in a triangular blue and
orange battle flag [4 gp]. A tiny silver box [20 gp]
holds a polished oval tigereye [22 gp] and a small
silver key [3 gp] while a black leather pouch [1
gp] holds silver and copper coins [82 sp, 116 cp].
[Total 499.36 gp]
10 You open a wooden carrying case [50 gp] stained
a rich brown, and find an amazing array of tools
resting on the blue velvet inside, each resting
neatly within a specially designed niche. Three
leaded-glass inkwells [15 gp each], each holding a
different color ink, are stoppered and sit neatly
at the right of the case, near an assortment of
ink pens and charcoal pencils [5 pens, 8 pencils;
1 sp each]. A bronze sextant [112 gp] lies partially
disassembled; the expertly maintained gears
and levers gleam in the light. A few ‘string and
awl’ draftsman’s compasses [4 compasses, 4 gp
each] lie coiled around a mechanical compass
[60 gp], precision crafted from copper and silver.
The handle of the compass is a miniature globe
showing a fairly accurate representation of the
world. Several wooden rulers [5 rulers; 1 gp each],
a light iron ruler [3 gp], and a walnut tee-square
[12 gp] sit patiently in their niches. A pair of
gold tongs [40 gp] rest opened, above a golden
ceremonial hammer [50 gp]. Both tongs and
hammer are emblazoned with mathematical formulae
and mysterious runes. A semi-hidden
compartment at the bottom of the carrying case
holds two square-cut emeralds the size of big
roaches [50 gp each] and a few, long-outdated
promissory notes. [Total 494.3 gp]
11 You find a wooden chest [2 gp] with no lock,
clasps of brass and a thick leather strap which
buckles on the top for easier portability. Within
the weathered chest you discover a tapestry [300
gp], roughly five hand-spans across. When the
tapestry is unrolled, you can see it is ten handspans
long, and portrays a woodland scene with
human, spear-wielding hunters cornering a wild
boar. Also once the tapestry is unrolled, more
items are revealed: one small ring [70 gp] of tarnished
silver set with a pale milky white chalcedony
and a gold signet ring [20 gp] sized for a
large man’s finger, the face of which has been
rubbed almost smooth by wear and time.
Wrapped in several lengths of eggshell-blue
the mother of all treasure tables
42
braided cord [1 gp] is an ornate pewter hair comb
[5 gp] and a single bloodstone carved in a pattern
of flowering vines [40 gp]. Lining the bottom of
the chest are two faded bolts of pale, gray silk [6
yards; 10 gp each], beneath which are 3 coins [3
gp]. [Total 500 gp]
12 A locked brass strongbox [Average lock; strongbox
52 gp], about the size of a large dog, seems to
hold great promise, if you can open it. The
strongbox is ornately carved, showing a lowrelief
scene of merchants haggling over a simply
rendered market table. Once opened, you discover
five palm-sized gold sheets [10 gp each]
used to gilt rings, and under them, ten tiny iron
ingots [5 gp] used to make low-quality ‘gilded’
rings for the rubes. Beneath the metal, you find
a coiled length of copper wire [5 gp], several
chunks of brass [broken off a statue 5 gp], a
thumb-sized silver ingot [1 lb, 5 gp] and a pair of
uncut garnets [47 gp each]. A leather bag [1 gp]
holds four clear quartz crystals, cut to imitate
diamonds [47 gp each]. A golden eagle pendant
lies unfinished amid the stones; it is missing the
jeweled feathers which should be set into the
design, but is still valuable [26 gp]. Amid the
wealth, you find a small collection of jeweler’s
picks, small hammers, miniscule rasps and razorsharp
craft knives, wrapped in canvas [jeweler’s
tools, 5 gp]. Coins have also been tossed into the
box. You find at least 100 ‘gold pieces’ of counterfeit
gilded coins [worth only 10 gp to a thief],
and some real gold and silver [45 gp, 91 sp].
[Total 500.1 gp]
13 In a small barrel [or sack, 2 gp], you find a small
suit of masterwork leather armor [75 gp], sized to
fit a halfling of average height and sturdy build.
The chest of the armor is tooled and dyed to
portray a great tree of many thick branches,
each bough heavy with red, ripe fruit. There are
several cuts in the back of the armor, as if caused
by the piercing of a fine blade. On the bottom of
the barrel are five thunderstones [30 gp each],
and a glass eye of a milky white and snake-green
color, with an onyx pupil [100 gp]. The eye is
quite large, much larger than even a human man
could sport without much discomfort. There is a
small bore hole in the top of the eye, and upon
further examination of the barrel you find a tiny
metal loop [2 sp] with a screw-tip that fits it. You
also find a chain shirt [50 gp], sized to match the
wearer of the leather armor, a small pewter
medallion, scratched and worn from handling
[25 gp], and several coins [9 pp]. [Total 492.2 gp]
14 Opening a large teak chest [45 gp], banded with
rusting strips of pig-iron, you discover the tools
of the torturer’s trade arrayed neatly inside. The
tools are wrapped individually in red and white
checked cloths, but their purpose is obvious
from the bulges and deep brownish red stains
spotting the cloths. Two pair of thick copper
thumbscrews [30 gp each] are wrapped in a single
cloth, their circumference decorated with sneering
cherubs and howling angels. A collapsible
rattan cane [40 gp] is stored, neatly folded; it has
a piece of malachite on the pommel in the shape
of a scurrying rat. When outstretched, the cane
is as tall as a man. A blue satin pouch [10 gp]
holds a fist-sized, pear-shaped contraption of
iron and silver, opening like a flower when an
intricately machined hand crank is turned [120
gp]. Four herringbone flensing knives [15 gp
each] with knobby bronze hilts are wrapped in a
single square of cloth. A green silk garrote with
gilded handles [108 gp] sits inside a walnut box.
The garrote’s handles are carved in the shape of
skeletons, which appear to be pulling the deadly
cord with all their might. Under the torture
equipment, you find a waxed packet containing
mixed silver and gold coins [48 gp, 40 sp], and a
single piece of platinum [1 pp], shaped like a
miniature sword. [Total 505 gp]
15 Hanging on the wall is a bag apparently woven
from hair [50 gp], held up by a peg driven into
the wall. The human hair is of all conceivable
hues, long and lustrous, most probably from
women’s heads. Opening the metal catch at the
top of the bag and looking inside, you find several
sheets of parchment rolled together. Pulling
the parchment out and carefully unwrapping the
red tape holding them together, you can see five
pages which skillfully combine poetry [DM note:
in any local, common language] and sketching,
evoking feelings of nostalgia for the past with a
wistful yearning for spiritual solitude [total 150
gp]. Secondly, at the bottom of the bag is a flat,
unlocked wooden box with a sliding lid containing
a set of 99 ivory divining rods, each one
about the size of a quill pen [set 300 gp]. [DM
note: hold the rods in the hands and shake them
while concentrating on the question to be answered.
When one or more come out and fall to the ground,
the skilled user claims to be able to interpret the
future.] [Total 500 gp]
16 On the floor [ground] are three twenty-five
pound sacks [3 sp] labeled ‘flour’. Each is opened
and has flour spilling out of the top. [The characters
will not notice anything unusual about the sacks
until they investigate them. If they do, read the following:]
The sacks are much too heavy and clink
oddly when lifted. Buried in the flour are hundreds
of coins from more than a dozen different
kingdoms [152 gp, 1125 sp, 3508 cp combined
table IV: 500 gold pieces
43
from all three sacks]. Sifting through the coins
you also find a soapstone figurine carved in the
likeness of a man on a horse [either a famous king
or simply a random person; 35 gp] in the first sack.
The flour in the second sack is burying, along
with the coins, 27 ingots of pure silver [each one
pound, 5 gp each]. Under the coins and flour in
the last sack is a small wooden box [5 sp] holding
six small statuettes, each in the shape of a
farm animal [5 gp each]. All are clockwork contraptions
which, when properly wound, walk
and make the appropriate animal noise. There is
a cow, a horse, a chicken, a pig, a goat, and a
sheep. The flour from the top of the sacks is now
completely worthless; thanks to the coins, it
now smells of metal. [Total 500.38 gp]
17 Two shelves [2 sp each] are anchored into the
wall just above head height for a typical human.
Standing guard on the first shelf is a collection
of small pewter figures. There are 20 in all; 10
are fashioned as warriors carrying longswords
and the other 10 are fierce orcs with battleaxes
[2 gp each]. The figures appear to be battling over
a ceramic tea service [25 gp total] which includes
a tea pot, four teacups and saucers, a tray, a sugar
bowl, and a pair of delicate silver spoons all
marked with strange heraldry. This shelf also
carries a large ceramic jar labeled ‘Tea’. In spite
of the label, it holds hundreds of gold, silver and
copper coins [45 gp, 347 sp, 297 cp]. The second
shelf, set higher than the first, holds a bullseye
lantern [12 gp] and a gallon jug of lamp oil [8 sp]
as well as a set of books standing upright
between two polished agate bookends [200 gp
set]. The pair of antique books details the history
and lineage of neighboring kingdoms [50 gp
each]. A small beaten-gold dish [15 gp] holding a
pair of gold hoop earrings [22 gp] rounds out the
collection of items. [Total 497.87 gp]
18 Within the interior of a battered leather satchel
[4 cp] you find a slightly chipped flat box. The
surface of the box is inlaid with ivory and seems
to be somewhat serpentine in design. A small
silver catch forms the head of a snake, the upper
and lower jaws locking together to hold the
whole thing in place. Fitted into the box are
three daggers with curious X-shaped blades.
Each one is made from silver and has an ivory
hilt carved in the shape of a serpent set with a
green-colored gemstone [jade] between its fangs
[set including box 315 gp; individually these items
will sell for 5 to 10% less to a discerning collector].
Also in the satchel is a green velvet bag [5 sp]
holding a cut-glass phial with a silver stopper [1
gp] containing a dubious-looking brown liquid
[poison – bloodroot; 100 gp]. A leather pouch [1
gp] contains some small cut gems of various
shapes and sizes [carnelian, 12 gp; chalcedony, 14
gp; citrine, 21 gp; jasper, 18 gp; moonstone, 15 gp].
Rolling around the satchel you also find some
loose coins, each one is minted from a different
kingdom [3 gp, 15 sp, 35 cp]. [Total 501.94 gp]
19 A gilded, broadhead spear [22 gp] whose oak haft
has been painted a colorful red and green, juts
from an enormous wine vase [53 gp] which
stands nearly as tall as a child. Looking closer at
the spear, you notice cheerfully obscene pictograms
scored into the head. The vase itself is
finely fired clay, painted ochre and black and
decorated with flat images of nude athletes in
competition. Peering into the vase, you catch
the glint of treasure inside. First you see a conical
leather cap [95 gp], whose brim has been
ringed with solid silver bands shaped like leaping
dolphins. It has been upended to contain a
cornucopia of wealth. A white tassel, as long as
your arm, juts from the ostentatious cap’s crown.
Inside the ceremonial helm, you discover a
weighty pile of gold and silver coins, all minted
by the same prosperous city-state [42 gp, 518 sp].
Resting on the vase’s floor are a pair of red
spinels, each the size of a large pea, whose edges
have been polished so keenly they can draw
blood when carelessly handled [120 gp each].
[Total 503.8 gp]
20 Five pottery bowls [5 cp each] sit on the floor
[ground] in front of you. Each is the length of a
human forearm in diameter and a foot deep. The
first one holds a large mound of silver coins [534
sp]. The second one contains a variety of toiletries.
Inside you find a bone-handled hairbrush
[2 gp], a silver comb [6 gp], rose scented soap
wrapped in linen [1 gp], a vial of lilac perfume
[18 gp], and two vials of scented oil: one smells
of gardenia, the other like raspberry [33 gp each].
In the bottom of the bowl is a small pair of
tweezers made of steel [1 gp]. The third bowl
holds copper pieces, a few more than were in the
bowl of silver coins [660 cp]. The fourth bowl
has a nice stack of gold coins [177 gp]. The fifth
and final bowl looks like someone’s stash of gambling
supplies. On top is a small gameboard.
Rather than black and white squares, this one
has inlays of blue and dark gray [lapis lazuli and
hematite, 128 gp]. In a small pouch [5 sp] are the
playing pieces, 16 of each color, matching the
gameboard [1 gp each]. You also find a deck of
playing cards on parchment [vellum, 10 gp], and
three pairs of bone dice [1 gp per pair]. [Total
504.75 gp]
21 You can see a dark-colored cloak [18 gp] hanging
on a peg on the wall. The distinctive cloak is
the mother of all treasure tables
44
made from a rich, grey felt and would fit a young
woman or someone of similar stature. The cloak
has two deep pockets. The first one you try is
empty but the other contains a small leather
purse [15 gp] with exquisite silver stitching in an
eagle’s head design. Inside the purse is a nugget
[20 gp] of some metallic ore [could be tin or uranium
or another dark, whitish colored metal] about
the size of a child’s thumb and a rabbit’s foot [no
monetary value] which might have been lucky for
someone. [If the characters further search the cloak,
the find a series of small lumps inside a seam].
Opening a small portion of the seam [which can
be easily repaired] reveals four stones of a calming,
smoky green color [green garnet, 110 gp
each]. [Total 493 gp]
22 You see a heavy woolen fabric rolled up inside
out, it looks like a tapestry [350 gp]. Once
unrolled, you see it is about the size of a normal
door, smells faintly of mold and several objects
are tucked inside. It illustrates a massive mountain
spire with a spiraling path winding around
it. On the path is a line of nobles of all races,
each separated by a different monster. This
strange procession is marching its way towards
the mountain’s peak, where a bright star is balanced;
the rays of light from the star are picked
out with gold thread. Nestled inside the rolled
up tapestry are six wooden goblets [24 gp each],
each with two pieces of turquoise set into its
stem, and a velvet bag [3 gp] which makes a rattling
noise as you pick it up. Inside the bag is a
collection of holy symbols carved out of different
kinds of wood [various deities, good and evil; 6
symbols, 1 gp each]. Each symbol has a small wire
fitted to it, allowing it to be worn on a cord or
necklace. [Total 503 gp]
23 There is a low wooden door set into one wall [if
outdoors, this could be a hidden pit] with a small
grill set into the middle. However, it is dark
beyond the grill making it difficult to see what
lies beyond. The grill is old, heavy and locked.
[It will require magical means or extreme strength to
break it down]. Inside is a dismal scene in which
as many as eight human-sized skeletons lie
chained to each other and to the walls. [The
skeletons are all completely inanimate]. Indeed,
they seem to be chained up to an excessive
extent because lengths of chain surround every
limb, sometimes more than once. The chains
attach to hooks in the ceiling and high on the
walls, hoisting legs and bodies topsy-turvy into
the air and would have been the source of considerable
suffering. Still, the chains are finely
made from interlocking steel links and are lightly
oiled to prevent rusting so that, although it
would take a bit of trouble to disentangle it all,
the chains themselves might be useful or indeed
valuable [total 170 feet of oiled chains, weight 34
lbs, 510 gp]. [Total 510 gp]
24 In the corner of the room [In a tree] a rope hangs
from a pulley mechanism. As you approach you
find the device is connected to a square section
cut into the ceiling [a square platform hanging in
the tree] near the pulley. [If a character uses the
pulley:] As you begin to pull, the square section
lowers and you see a large wooden chest [3 gp]
sitting on it. Opening the chest, you find thousands
of loose coins [24,600 cp]. You push your
hands into the chest full of coins and within seconds
you feel something soft. You retrieve a bundle
of silk cloth; examination reveals 6 tissuethin
handkerchiefs [10 gp each]. Each one is artisan
created and trimmed with a floral design.
Reaching into the chest again, you touch several
hard objects; a discovery of four ivory scroll
tubes [47 gp each, tubes are empty]. Each tube has
an intricate design of vines from one end to the
other carved into it, and the ends are gold plated.
[Total 497 gp]
25 Various treasures are piled haphazardly beneath
a luxurious green-and-red leather military saddle
[102 gp]. The red leather saddle is stitched with
green floral patterns, and fitted with ornately
carved stirrups. A dark green saddleblanket [11
gp] has been tied around the saddle’s pommel,
and is fringed with colorful rattles. A well made
pair of leather riding boots [25 gp], complete
with brass spurs in the shape of wildflowers, rest
under the saddle. A pair of spears [25 gp each]
with dark wood hafts and points of alchemical
silver lie half-concealed by the other items. A
pair of green silk riding gloves [29 gp] trimmed
with ermine lie under the boots. Beneath the
gloves, you find a plush grey rabbit-fur coat [50
gp], adorned with gold epaulets and honor-braid.
In one of the coat’s pockets, you find an unusual
military medal [15 gp]: a burgundy ribbon with a
single tiny platinum star set at the center. The
pocket also holds a pair of heart-shaped gold earrings
on wide loops [22 gp]. A dark blue officer’s
tunic [5 gp] trimmed with gray hides a belt [29
gp] made from various gold and silver coins. At
the bottom of the stack sets a blue glass bowl [6
gp], so full of gold and silver coins that they spill
out onto the floor [63 gp, 987 sp]. [Total 505.7 gp]
26 You find a pile of weapons obviously used and
once in excellent condition, now neglected.
There are spots on the blades which need a bit
of cleaning and oiling before rusting in earnest.
The wooden shafts should be oiled and cleaned,
as should the leather of the hafts [which are
table IV: 500 gold pieces
45
beginning to dry out]. However there is nothing
wrong with them that a good cleaning and a little
sharpening will not fix; a little routine maintenance
around the campfire will easily return
them to full serviceability. The weapons consist
of two halberds [10 gp each], four short swords
[10 gp each], a heavy mace [12 gp], three spears [5
gp each], eight daggers [2 gp each], two throwing
axes [8 gp each], and four light shields [9 gp
each.]. Besides the weapons you find two suits of
chainmail [150 gp each], and two suits of leather
armor [10 gp each]. There are also four belt
pouches of leather with small wooden buttons
for latches [1 gp each]. Each pouch contains a
variety of coins. [1 pp, 4 gp, 17 sp, 4 cp; 5 gp, 12
sp, 16 cp; 3 gp, 11 sp, 21 cp; 4 gp, 5 sp, 9 cp].
[Total 510 gp]
27 This area is a complete mess. It looks as if somebody
has intentionally torn the place apart. The
clutter makes it hard to look for any valuables,
but you begin your search. The first thing you
find is a large purse full of gold [164 gp]. You continue
your search of the room [tent, cave] and
under a pile of torn pillows and loose goose
down you find a longbow [75 gp] and a quiver
with 40 arrows in it [2 gp]. Further rummaging
reveals a blank spellbook [15 gp] under a pile of
ripped up clothing; and a suit of scale mail armor
[50 gp] under an upturned, broken table. When
you have spent several minutes going through
the room, you seem to have found everything of
any worth. Then as you turn to leave you notice
two paintings on the wall. They both depict
winged, dark creatures, possibly gargoyles, flying
across a cloudy, dark sky. In the first painting the
creatures are coming toward you and in the second
one they are flying away from you. Neither
painting strikes you as particularly impressive
but they may be worth something on the open
market [97 gp each]. [Total 500 gp]
28 A large, but simple canvas satchel [2 gp] hangs
heavy with tools and supplies. Inside the satchel,
you find four sets of high-quality racing horseshoes.
Two of the sets are made from hard iron
[12 gp each], and the other two are made from
softer bronze [10 gp each]. All the horseshoes are
chipped and scratched from long use. A pair of
steel gelder’s shears [5 gp], a heavy iron hammer
[2 gp], and long leather breeder’s gloves [2 gp] are
also stuffed into the canvas bag as is a leather
sack [1 gp] full of short nails [5 gp total], lengths
of string and leather [5 cp], and some possible
odd-shaped bronze coins [70 coins, 35 gp to collectors].
An inside compartment of the satchel
holds a coiled leather whip, tipped with a set of
copper talons like a raven’s [5 gp], and a miniature
dagger made of silver [10 gp]. Another pocket,
further inside the bag, holds a decorative pectoral
[120 gp], hammered from a thin sheet of
gold and worn on leather straps. A squatting
woman, rendered in geometric simplicity, adorns
the breastplate. Stuffed in beside the pectoral is
a knotted leather necklace with dangling pieces
of tigereye interspersed with lapis lazuli [27 pieces
total, 272 gp]. [Total 503.05 gp]
29 A worn and battered traveling case [1 gp] rests in
a corner. When new, it was a fine, sturdy case of
leather and wood, but time, travel, and weather
have taken their toll. Now the leather is starting
to crack in places, but there are no holes, and it
still appears to be functional. Inside, you find an
ivory-handled hairbrush [5 gp], an ivory comb
with a single small moonstone [30 gp], and a tiny
ivory hand mirror [15 gp]. The case is also
packed with clothing sized for a human child,
although a halfling could wear most of it easily.
The clothes consist of a pair of frilly white dresses
with lace, stockings, a petticoat, and two pairs
of leather shoes with brass buckles [2 child’s
courtier’s outfits, 15 gp each gp]. A small leather
case [5 sp] holds cosmetics—lipstick, rouge, and
eye makeup [1 gp each] and a small vial of rosescented
lotion [3 gp]. Tucked under the clothing
is half a vial of ink [4 gp], an inkpen [1 sp] and a
small children’s workbook written in common
and draconic [5 sp]. A small tiara made of silver
and studded with flecks of coral [210 gp] is
wrapped in one of the dresses. At the bottom of
the case, a purse [1 gp] holds over a dozen platinum
coins [18 pp]. [Total 503.1 gp]
30 Inside a nicked and dented carrying case [5 gp]
made of wood covered in black leather, you find
a masterwork lap harp [160 gp] with ivory tuning
pegs. One side of the body of the harp features
inlaid knotwork designs done in white birch
wood, while the other is carved with runes of
travel and good fortune. The harp’s strings look
almost brand new. Next to the harp case is a
wooden walking stick [220 gp] as tall as a man,
which has a carving of a bearded wizard’s head at
the top and a brass cap at the bottom. The wizard’s
beard twines around the staff, and he has
gems for eyes: the left one is a bloodstone, while
the right is a sphere of amethyst. The wizard’s
expression is one of extreme distaste. Several
metal hooks are mounted at the top end of the
staff, with two small bags and a pouch tied to
them. The bags are full of mixed coins [14 gp, 50
sp, 200 cp], while the pouch holds a smokestick
[20 gp], two sunrods [2 gp each], a vial of what
looks like milk [antitoxin, 50 gp] and two pieces
of rhodocrosite [10 gp each]. [Total 500 gp]
the mother of all treasure tables
46
31 [If located outdoors, this treasure should be placed in
sacks or bags or perhaps hanging from suitably
placed trees.] Hanging from the ceiling in dozens
of different places are bells of just about every
imaginable shape and size. There are seventeen
regular bells of no great interest [17 gp], four
much larger bells which have been set into the
likeness of giantess heads with snake-formed
clappers [50 gp each], seventy-four tiny brass finger
bells threaded onto pieces of string [value 7.4
gp], eight delicate fist-sized bells cast in the
shape of farmyard animals [two each of ducks,
geese, sheep and pigs, 8 gp each], a leaded glass bell
in the shape of a carp [25 gp] and a gold bell the
size and shape of a sparrow [85 gp]. Finally, you
realize that what is holding up the bells is a
length of connected silk rope which is itself of
value [500 ft of silk rope, 100 gp]. [Total 498.4 gp]
32 You locate a rectangular steel case, an arm’s
length long, a forearm’s length wide and deep.
[footlocker, 5 gp]. It is locked with a padlock
[Average lock, 40 gp], but in a stroke of good
luck, the key is currently sticking out of the lock
itself. Clicking open the latch, you raise the lid
to discover what appears to be someone’s work
tools. Resting on top is a large hammer, tongs,
bellows, and other forge tools [masterwork
smithing tools, 55 gp]. They are well-used but in
good condition. Below these are three sacks [1 sp
each] of the craftsman’s wares. The first holds
horseshoes [80 horseshoes, 3 cp each], all unused.
Additionally, there are a number of shoe nails in
the bottom of the sack [320 nails, 1 cp each]. The
second holds two pounds of soap [1 gp] wrapped
in cloth and a wooden box [5 sp] of coins [201
gp, 450 sp, 515 cp]. The third bag holds a number
of assorted items: iron nails [562, 1 cp each],
hinges [63, 2 sp each], handles [71, 1 sp each],
small iron boxes [15, 5 sp each], and two sets of
leatherworking tools [both masterwork, 55 gp
each]. Under the sacks are two blankets [3 sp
each], both of which show singe and scorch
marks. [Total 501.97 gp]
33 At first it looks like a living person is standing
here, but this is just a trick of the light. You soon
realise that it is a mannequin of a human dressed
in armour and weapons. Made of a waxy substance,
it might be of value to a shop owner or
student of the arts as a model [50 gp]. It is wearing
an appropriately-sized set of chainmail [150
gp] and a heavy, steel shield is mounted on what
would be its left arm [20 gp]. The right hand has
a longsword [15 gp] attached to it. However,
looking a little more closely, you find items of
slightly greater value: first, the greaves which
would protect the mannequin’s lower legs are
actually made from a silver alloy and, although
too soft to be of much use as armor, are very decorative
[200 gp]. Second, hidden within a square
of cloth sewn into the inside the chainmail, is
the shrunken head of a dwarf which has a fetish
of crow’s feathers in its hair and a small carnelian
ear stud in the right ear [70 gp]. [Total 505 gp]
34 The three-legged bronze cooking pot [31 gp] is
decorated with images of geometric dancing
beasts which might be horses, or could be something
much more fanciful. Time has turned the
pot the soft, mossy green of aged metal, and
years of use and wear have obscured the onceimpressive
carvings. Lifting the pot’s lid, you are
assailed by the scent of old rot and ancient
spices. Inside, treasure is piled haphazardly. A
blunt-tipped ceremonial short sword [192 gp]
cast from solid silver and inscribed by entwined
serpents rests atop a pile of musty and moth
eaten green cloth. Beside the sword is a small
leather bag [1 sp], tied with purple thread; opening
the bag, you discover [and possibly prick your
finger on] a set of a dozen golden fishhooks [4 gp
each]. Beneath the leather bag, you find a trio of
bronze brooches [30 gp each], each studded with
a ring of tiny cowrie shell studs nestled together.
A ceremonial ivory mask [136 gp] depicting a
laughing young woman with diamonds painted
on her cheeks in green lies at the bottom of the
pot, wrapped in yellowed linen [1 gp]. Though
cracked, the mask is still clearly valuable, and
would be worth something to a collector. [Total
498.1 gp]
35 You find a large wooden casket [105 gp] carved
with various iconic images of cats, cats at play,
cats at rest and cats looking imperious. It is set
with a dark red stone [red garnet], which is
formed in the shape of a lion’s head with the
jaws at the front of the chest and open to show
the keyhole, the casket is three spans [forefinger
to thumb] in length and quite deep. At the bottom
of the box each leg is carved in the shape of
a cat’s paw and ends in tiny white claws. Within
the casket is a small lion statue made from a
curious green stone [soapstone, 100 gp] about as
tall as an average man’s hand. A small dark
brown leather bag, kept closed by a leather
drawstring, holds assorted coinage [10 sp, 19 gp,
3 pp; each coin has a small lion or cat head upon the
surface]. Two figurines of cats made from a
warm-colored golden stone [amber, 100 gp each]
and a necklace set with a gleaming red gemstone
[bloodstone: 50 gp] shaped in the image of a cat’s
paw. The necklace has a long thin chain made
of plated metal and each tiny link shows exquisite
craftsmanship. [Total 505 gp]
table IV: 500 gold pieces
47
36 An old, cluttered table [15 gp] sits off to one
side, a chair [5 gp] drawn up to it. Stacks of
papers rest on the left side of the table beneath
an inkpen [1 sp] and three full vials of ink [8 gp
each]. About half of the paper stack is covered in
illegible scribbling and doodles, but there are 33
unused sheets [4 sp each]. Next to the paper is an
antique hourglass. You can see that beneath the
dust, the base is made of fine marble, and the
glass is actually delicate crystal [80 gp]. This rests
next to a silver letter opener shaped like an
ornate greatsword [5 gp]. On the right side of the
table is a small stack of books which, according
to the titles, are the journals of Eldin
Dunkelheim [a renowned adventurer and hero in
dwarven communities or any other similar person,
16 books, 15 gp each]. The books sit directly in
front of the porcelain vase [5 gp], which is decorated
with painted flowers. Inside the vase is a
collection of coins [99 gp, 103 sp, 51 cp, all fairly
new and from the local kingdom]. The table
itself is worn and stained but sturdy and serviceable,
and the chair is slightly wobbly, but is still
useable. [Total 497.11 gp]
37 The bookshelf [9 gp] up against the wall holds
several interesting objects. The first thing to
catch your eye is a silver decanter [43 gp] sitting
on the top shelf. It is about 8 inches tall and 4
inches wide. A scene of a stag standing in a
glade is carved into it with exacting detail. On
the shelf below you find 5 books [17 gp each].
Each book is bound in hard, dark leather and
contains 100 pages. These leaves are empty, so
they could be used as new spellbooks, diaries, or
map books. Beside the books you see a small
wooden box with a hinged top [the box is 5 inches
wide, 3 inches high and 4 inches deep; 7 gp]. You
lift the top, finding platinum pieces [32 pp]
inside. Finally on the bottom shelf you notice
two folded, hooded cloaks. Each cloak is made
of soft, thin leather, and is handsomely crafted.
The two cloaks are perfect for medium sized people
and look as if they would provide warmth
and protection from rain or snow [23 gp each].
[Total 510 gp]
38 A wooden sea chest [5 gp] with leather handles
has been painted a cheerful blue, and decorated
with brilliant yellow diamond shapes cut from
pine. Inside are an assortment of toys and even
a few weapons, all designed to fit a small hand.
A silk blanket [20 gp], navy blue with red and
gold trim, is wrapped around a miniature mace
[15 gp]. The wooden mace has been painted in a
rainbow pattern and finished with tight copper
bands. Beneath the mace, you find a small round
shield [25 gp] made of a light bronze, acid-etched
with running stallions. Under the shield are a
pile of toys, two dozen of carved, articulated
wooden soldiers [10 gp each] armed with goldtipped
spears and equipped with minute bronze
breastplates. Among the wooden soldiers are a
pair of dragon puppets, both made from intricately
stitched cloth; each scale has been picked
out with fine threads or tiny beads [40 gp each].
One of the dragons is a forest green, the other is
royal purple with a red underbelly and iridescent
wings. Two pairs of grey leather gloves [10 gp
each], cut to fit a small woman, or a child, are
balled up under the toy dragons; red ribbons
decorate the backs. Inside one of the gloves, you
find a man’s ring [90 gp], a heavy, square lump of
gold inlaid with a tiger eye. [Total 495 gp]
39 Inside a plain hemp sack [1 sp] is a handsome
wooden chest [Average lock; chest, 235 gp] about
one forearms length in all dimensions. The
chest is set with half a dozen chips of garnet and
is highly polished. Fortunately, the small silver
key is still sitting in the lock. Opening the chest
you immediately see three large books, leatherbound
and protected by brass clasps. Each book,
when opened, contains six beautiful purple butterflies
carefully pinned to each page [3 butterfly
albums, 80 gp each]. The butterflies seem to be
virtually identical apart from minor variations
in size. Beneath these albums is a small velvet
bag [2 sp] containing gold pieces [15 gp] and a
shark’s tooth [3 gp]. There is also a twist of
parchment which contains a tiny corked glass
bottle with an unknown clear liquid inside [the
tears of a clown, 7 gp]. [With additional searching,
characters discover the chest has a false bottom.]
Beneath it is hidden the diary of a nameless
young girl who seems to have had many emotional
ups and downs but in general lived an
exceptionally uninteresting life [1 gp]. [Total
501.3 gp]
40 Standing in one corner is a grey-brown container
about a foot across and thrice that high. It
appears to have been hollowed-out, based on
what is inside it, and the outside is leathery with
several large horny pads on the bottom [elephant’s
foot, 60 gp]. Inside the container are
crammed a dozen spears of different shapes and
sizes. Six of these are seven-foot longspears [5 gp
each] which are well made but no different from
any other such spear. One is a standard length
but its haft is wrapped in silver wire [50 gp]. The
next is another longspear which is painted all
along its shaft with unknown and unusual looking
glyphs and runes. [These are not magical and
have no effect beyond being pretty, 7 gp]. The
ninth weapon has a strange curving head but is
the mother of all treasure tables
48
not otherwise exceptional [8 gp]. Two of the others
are made from finest mahogany with very
shiny steel edges, although being only shortspears
in length [20 gp each]. The final spear is
the shortest – just a javelin, in fact – but it is
superbly made. [An expert can determine it has a
sturdy haft of finest treated ash wood and a head of
meteoric iron-forged steel quenched in the best horse
urine; masterwork javelin, 301 gp]. [Total 496 gp].
41 You find a good-quality wooden chest, painted
green [4 gp]. Inside is a coverlet fit for a king,
made of ivory silk and stuffed with the finest
goose down [230 gp]. The entire center is
embroidered in gold thread in an elaborate oval
medallion. Lying in the bottom of the chest are
a pair of gold wall sconces, built up from narrow
tips in successive layers of curling leaves. Instead
of a candleholder at the top, each has a long
opening which goes deep into the holder [wall
vases, 135 gp each]. [Total 504 gp]
42 A dusty leather backpack [2 gp] sits in the corner
of the room. As you open it, the backpack falls
to pieces and its contents spill out. Loose coins
roll around the room, making quite a racket [13
gp, 97 sp, 148 cp]. A small wooden box [1 gp]
makes a dull thudding sound as it hits the
ground, and an ivory scroll case [14 gp] rolls out
of the pack last, making a scratchy sound as it
comes to rest on the floor. You open the wooden
box, discovering a magnificent writing set [set
104 gp]. The set includes five pens, each one
gold plated, and ending in a silver fashioned
quill. Also in the box you find three small sealed
silver bottles [the ink has dried up over time]. The
pens and bottles are pristine, with no mark or
scratch on them of any kind. You turn your
attention to the scroll case, lifting it from the
floor, it feels heavier than you expect. Inside you
find a collection of small stamps made of silver
[the kind used to stamp letters on paper with ink].
There is one stamp for every letter of the alphabet,
and they are quite impressively forged. [The
number of stamps equals the number of letters in the
alphabet of the common tongue and each one is
worth 14 gp; for a 26 letter alphabet the total is 364
gp]. [Total 509.18 gp]
43 As you search, you find a pine coffin covered
with some small pieces of cloth [two pieces of
wool, 3 gp each]. [If the party opens the coffin,
read:] There is no body or bones in the coffin;
instead it holds a suit of banded mail armor covered
in dust [300 gp]. The armor has been modified,
small spikes covering its surface. The
spikes would deal a bit of damage to anyone
foolish enough to grapple with the wearer. As
you lift the armor from its resting place you see
two more items: a lock with a key in it, and a silver
necklace with a blue quartz pendant [47 gp].
You check the lock [Amazing lock, 150 gp], and
the key does unlock it. [Total 497 gp]
44 Wrapped in a dirty piece of rich velvet [1 gp],
you find a set of small silver and purple worry
beads [40 beads, siberite gems every tenth bead;
300 gp]. The beads are strung together in a circle
which is a bit too big to act as a bracelet on a
human male. The few purple stones are polished
smoothed by the continuous rubbing, possibly
by some merchant’s hand. You also find two
rings, perhaps from the very same fingers which
worried these stones. One ring is plain silver set
with a small black stone [onyx; 40 gp] and the
other an intriguing elfin work of intertwined
platinum bands set with a gleaming white stone
[moonstone; 150 gp]. [Total 491 gp]
45 A small iron chest [1 gp] is located close to one
wall [or could also be outside tucked away somewhere].
It is locked [Simple padlock, 20 gp] but the
key is in the lock and it is the work of an instant
to open it. Inside, you find a brightly-coloured
piece of cloth which, as you pull it out to admire
it more closely, is revealed to be a banner or pennant
suitable for hanging from a lance or a herald’s
trumpet [150 gp]. The banner is two yards
long and half of one wide, created from cloth-ofgold
and embroidered with a dragon flying
between two moons and, below, a black trident.
Underneath the banner is a small leather purse
[2 sp] which, when opened, is found to contain
four lower sets of false teeth, human sized, cunningly
carved from crystal and ivory [70 gp each]
and a scrap of parchment which is so old the
inked message is faded and illegible. Finally, you
notice a tiny velvet bag [3 sp] just big enough to
house its contents, a silver ring with an
engraved silver design depicting tiny dragons
and tridents [50 gp]. [Total 501.5 gp]
46 In a medium-sized chest [Average lock; chest, 45
gp] of pale, carved wood, are four silver spoons
[12 gp each], the size one would use for soup,
each with a handle wrought to look like a different
type of flower: tulip, rose, violet, snapdragon.
The chest is also carved with a floral pattern,
although great gouges and divets have been
carved into it by wear, abuse and travel. Within
the chest are also seven bolts of fine, deep blue
lace [20 gp each], torn in some places but in overall
good condition. Carefully wrapped in the
lace are four porcelain plates, edged with silver
[14 gp each] and decorated with light, airy elven
script, again naming the four flowers depicted in
the other items. There is also a birchwood music
box [10 gp], its top scratched with four, even
table IV: 500 gold pieces
49
gouges, and four ivory wine goblets [50 gp each],
the stems of which are carved to liken the
appearance of long, elegant leaves. [Total 499 gp]
47 Lying here [on a table, on the floor or propped up
against a wall] you see a lengthy wooden board
just long enough for a human to rest upon
[portable torture board, 25 gp]. There are manacles
securely fastened to the board at five locations,
as if there was one for the neck and one
each for feet and hands [manacles, 15 gp each].
From one side of the board hang a variety of
leather straps in different widths and lengths,
studded – on the inside – with various sharp and
irregularly-shaped steel teeth [straps total 100 gp].
The ‘head’ of the board is inset with a slim
wooden drawer, lined with a row of what might,
optimistically, be considered surgical instruments
but which are certainly the tools of the
torturer – including teeth extractors and
piercers, nerve awakeners, vein slitters, bone
ticklers and nail pliers [steel tool set, 200 gp].
These are all carefully made from steel with
ivory and mother-of-pearl inset handles to prevent
blisters for the user. A final item is located
in a drawer on the other side of the board, a
hammer and chisel set with handles encrusted
in gold leaf [tool set, 100 gp]. [Total 500 gp]
48 A great mass of old and dusty spiders’ webs conceals
a canvas sack [2 cp]. Carefully bringing it
towards you, you realize gentle handling is necessary
for the smelly, cobweb-infused sack contains
what feels like glassware. Unwrapping the
contents proves this is indeed the case, as there
is a wide range of different types of glass containers,
each of which is crafted of translucent
crystal and protected by several strips of linen [2
sp]. There are six graceful goblets, ideal for sharing
a flagon of wine [30 gp each], a set of twelve
test tubes [10 gp each] to delight any alchemist
and a smaller set of four cruets [12 gp each] for
perhaps salt and pepper and a couple of other
condiments. A larger glass ale tankard bears an
intricate engraving of three snake-like dragons
biting each other’s tails [100 gp]. Finally, there is
a crystal paperweight with a large and dangerous-
looking beetle set inside, measuring as wide
across as man’s palm [50 gp]. [Total 498.22 gp].
49 You find a masterfully carved wooden chest with
silver fastenings and lock [Average lock; chest, 50
gp]. It is long enough to hold a good-sized bow or
a longsword with room to spare. Once opened,
you find a masterwork sword [440 gp] in the
chest. It is wrapped in blue silk [10 gp] and the
box is cut out so that the sword rests perfectly in
the box without moving around. The sword’s
cross hilt forms two diamond-shaped guards
with a beautiful gem of jet in each end. The hilt
is fine black leather wound with golden thread
and ends in an acorn-shaped pommel of gold.
[Total 500 gp]
50 A giant-sized blue pillowcase decorated with
embroidered white flowers [2 gp] has been
stuffed with treasure, holding the load
admirably. Inside you discover an excellent steel
breastplate [203 gp], designed to follow the contours
of the human body closely. The tight-fitting
armor imitates the human form, molded to
the shape of a strong man’s muscular chest. Two
rectangular steel bucklers [50 gp each], embossed
with silver runes, clang against the breastplate.
An iridescent red scale mail tunic [70 gp] rubs
against the other armor; the armor’s steel plating
has been painted a glistening metallic red, and
the cords which join segments of the armor are
a matching shade. A black leather satchel [3 gp]
marred by dozens of nicks and cuts contains an
assortment of long-handled hooks, lock picks,
files, miniature hammers and awls [theives’ tools,
30 gp] which would do any thief proud. Stuffed
into a poorly-concealed pocket of the thieves’
kit are three pieces of obsidian carved into dollsized
wine glasses [15 gp] and a wide variety of
gold coins [67 pieces are actually genuine. The
counterfeits are probably worth another 12 gp to an
interested buyer; 67 gp, 72 fakes]. [Total 513 gp]
51 A luxurious wooden open carriage [126 gp], spacious
enough for four people, stands against a
wall. Treasures have been piled on the carriage’s
plush green cushions [24 gp]. A triangular oak
case [1 gp] rests on one of the down pillows. Its
lid lifts off to show three pouches of pipeweed [2
gp each] and a new, well carved wooden pipe [20
gp]. In addition to the tobacco, a heavy glass jar
with a cork holds crushed tea leaves [10 gp],
which hiss and rattle softly. Two ivory and onyx
snuff boxes carved with fairies [55 gp each] lie in
the bottom of the case. A double-bladed battleaxe
[60 gp] leans against one of the carriage’s
wood wheels, both of its steel blades painted
with horrible fanged teeth, its handle carved
from sturdy oak. Under the seat, you find an
empty wine bottle filled with exotic arrowheads
[such as stone, obsidian, metal shaped by elves; 10
arrowheads, 50 sp each], and a small wooden box
[5 sp] which opens to reveal a gold ring studded
tiny garnets. The ring rattles around in the otherwise
empty box, and its inner surface has been
inscribed but only the initials B and T are still
legible [155 gp]. [Total 517.5 gp]
52 Two glass eyes [15 gp each], correct in every
anatomical detail, rest atop a dusty wooden lock
box [2 gp]. The blue eye has a small crack runthe
mother of all treasure tables
50
ning through it, but the green eye is unmarred.
In the top of the box is a pair of spiked steel
gauntlets [10 gp pair], the outer surfaces of which
have been enameled canary yellow. Beneath
them is folded a bright yellow velvet robe [52
gp], trimmed in black and white checks. Under
the clothes, you find a dagger with a serpentine
blade [5 gp] within a black and gold scabbard,
which is built into a leather belt [40 gp]. Lying
beneath the scabbard and belt, you find what
may be a holy symbol rendered in two precious
metals [85 gp]: a silver sword is upthrust through
a brass crescent moon, which has been allowed
to tarnish to a realistic grey-green. A glass vial at
the bottom of the case holds one small amethyst
the size of a baby’s finger nail [65 gp]. A single
golden gauntlet [205 gp] rests beside the vial.
This immobile, ceremonial gauntlet is hammered
so precisely it fits over the hand like a
second skin, and has been inscribed with helixes,
exploding sun disks, and leaping dancers.
Only the fingers are free of decoration, instead
replicating the appearance of human fingers,
down to the fine hairs and cuticles carved into
the soft gold. [Total 494 gp]
53 Inside a large chest made of plain wood banded
with iron [2 gp], you find two oddly shaped
leather packages, a hefty sack of coins [55 gp,
120 sp], two bottles of wine [one is an elven vintage,
42 gp; the other is dwarven, 65 gp], and a
metal shield [a light steel shield; 33 gp]. The
leather-wrapped packages turn out to contain
finely-made crossbows, one slightly smaller than
the other [heavy crossbow, 150 gp; light crossbow,
135 gp]. They are a matching pair, with ornately
carved stocks featuring ivory inlays depicting
scenes from the same epic battle [one suitable to
your campaign] and bolt-grooves made of polished
marble. Both bottles of wine are full and
each sits in a custom-made leather holder [3 gp
each] designed to protect it during travel. The
shield is steel, and looks to be designed more for
show than for use in battle. There is a thumbsized
spike at its center, capped with a leather
cover, and this is surrounded by a circle of twelve
demonic faces carved in relief. Their eyes are
picked out with deep red enamel. [Total 500 gp]
54 An octagonal seaman’s chest [30 gp], made of a
smooth, pale grey wood, and studded with
gleaming brass rings, is buried in stained and
faded old maps showing prime fishing spots and
underwater currents [15 gp]. After prying open
the reluctant lid, you find a pair of gold candlesticks
covered with dagger-sharp silver thorns
[110 gp each]. One of the sticks has been adorned
with miniature roses, enamelled in red. The
candlesticks rest atop a lime green linen vest
with carved black buttons [3 gp]. Under the vest
is a wool cap faded to a dingy grey with age [1
cp], and inside its brim you find a steel flask of
good wine [3 gp]. Digging deeper, you find a long
silver necklace with a single white pearl set in
the center of a pendant [125 gp], with delicate
line work that might represent the ocean. A
bronze lamp in the shape of a fat-bellied pig [6
gp] sits at the bottom of the chest, and instead of
oil, has been stuffed with four small leather bags
[2 sp each] filled with gold dust [about 1/2 pound
each, 25 gp each]. [Total 502.81 gp]
55 In a corner sits an oak chest with a silver clasp
and finishings [17 gp]. Inside are four pieces of
green silk [10 gp each], each wrapped around an
object. Inside the first are two ancient books on
alchemy: Unique Creations of Alchemy and
Dwarven Clerical Alchemy [43 gp and 62 gp]. The
second piece contains a small cedar box inlaid
with painted ceramic tiles [6 gp]. The box holds
six linen handkerchiefs embroidered with a
script L [or other letter] [1 gp each]. Inside the
third piece are five daggers, balanced for throwing
[12 gp each]. Each one is set with a small
black stone [obsidian] in the pommel. There is
also a used but serviceable whetstone [2 cp]. The
fourth length of silk is wrapped around a small
jewelry box [3 gp], which holds a jewelry set consisting
of a gold ring [22 gp], bracelet [37 gp], and
necklace [54 gp]. Each is set with blue-green
stones [turquoise]: one in the ring, three in the
bracelet, and seven in the necklace. Under the
silk-wrapped bundles are three belt pouches [1
gp each]. The first holds copper [187 cp], the second
contains silver [141 sp], and the third has
some gold with a smattering of platinum [7 pp,
54 gp]. [Total 492.99 gp]
56 This could be a weapons armory. There are a
large number of weapons everywhere although
many are broken. One weapon is so unique and
worthy of attention. It is a dire flail and you can
tell a master craftsman created the weapon [masterwork
dire flail, 390 gp]. After looking at length
at the finely crafted flail you begin to examine
the other weapons in the room. Most of them
were not crafted with the same care as the flail;
many of them are broken and unuseable.
However you do find a serviceable longsword
[15 gp], a battleaxe in good condition [10 gp], a
very nice light crossbow [35 gp], and a dwarven
waraxe [30 gp]. On the floor in the corner of the
room you also find several quivers [6] of crossbow
bolts [60 bolts; 6 gp]. Near a quiver you spot
a small pouch [1 sp] with a hand full of coins [9
gp, 9 sp, 50 cp]. [Total 496.5 gp]
table IV: 500 gold pieces
51
57 On the wall are three heavy steel shields decorated
with rearing horses [2 at 20 gp; one masterwork,
170 gp]. Before them stands a makeshift
wooden bar holding six steel tankards etched
with dragons [5 gp each], two crystal wine goblets
[10 gp each], and a hooded lantern [7 gp]. Next to
the bar is an open oak barrel [2 gp] containing a
number of spears of various lengths [three shortspears,
1 gp each; 4 spears, 2 gp each; 2 longspears,
5 gp each]. Behind the bar, you find three casks
of ale. Two are full [10 gp each], the third is onequarter
filled [2 gp, 5 sp]. There are several bottles
of wine of different ages and quality [15 bottles
of cheap wine, 1 gp each; 1 bottle at 5 gp; 2 bottles
at 10 gp; 1 at 50 gp]. A large, broken crate
holds salted meat [14 pounds, 6 sp per pound] and
a large wheel of cheese [4 sp]. Tucked into a corner
behind the bar are six pints of oil [1 sp each]
and a wooden box [2 cp] with the word ìfundsî
scrawled across it in red ink. The box holds a
loose collection of coins [31 gp, 120 sp, 187 cp]
and a few irregular, white stones [5 freshwater
pearls, 10 gp each]. [Total 506.79 gp]
58 A group of four matryoshka [nesting dolls] gazes at
you solemnly. Each is about half a foot tall, made
of delicate wood, and painted carefully. Despite
their age, they have weathered well. The first set
of dolls [10 gp set] depicts a king [local kingdom,
several hundred years previous]. Opening the doll
reveals his wife, then their heir, and finally their
Lord Chancellor. This final doll contains a thin
silver necklace set with a single piece of amber
[105 gp]. The second doll depicts a legendary
group of heroes and contains a total of five dolls
[8 gp set]. The third set represents evil dragons.
These progress from a large red dragon to blue,
black, green, and finally white at the center.
The white dragon is not a doll, but a small
alabaster figurine [50 gp set]. The final doll [10 gp
set], slightly larger than the others, is painted in
the representation of mythic characters and
fables. There are six dolls in this set; the smallest
is just an inch high. This last doll is surrounded
by two gold rings, each set with a large
brownish-red gem [carnelian, 137 gp each].
Sitting behind the dolls is a large drawstring
sack [1 sp] filled to the top with copper and silver
coins [397 sp, 552 cp]. [Total 502.32 gp]
59 Wrapped inside a bundle of shabby oil cloth is a
shiny, new-looking mandolin made from the
very best hard woods, with very fine catgut
strings and fretboards inlaid with ivory.
Strumming the strings produces a very pleasing
melody and the instrument almost seems to be
in tune [masterwork, 275 gp]. Almost unnoticed,
the oil cloth contains another treasure: a set of
five silver thimbles and five needles tied up in a
bundle of silk. The thimbles are fashioned in the
guise of mushrooms and the needles shaped like
tiny harpoons. Nevertheless, the needles remain
sharp and the thimbles are functional, although
suitable for a small set of fingers such as those of
a young girl [125 gp]. [If the characters look inside
the mandolin, read:] The instrument is not quite
in tune because a small cloth bag is affixed by
glue to the inside of the body of the mandolin.
This bag contains a thumb-high gold icon of a
fertility goddess with lapis lazuli for eyes [100
gp]. [Total 500 gp]
60 High up you see a large brown sack [2 sp]. It is
tied shut with a rope, which has also been used
to secure it. [If a character can reach the sack:]
After you retrieve the heavy sack, you remove
the rope and unwrap it. As it opens your nose is
hit with the mouth-watering smells of many
foods. You find several different types of hard
cheese [8 large chunks of cheese, 1 sp each], about
5 pounds of heavily salted, jerked beef [30 sp],
and 10 loaves of hard wheat bread [20 cp].
Under the food you also find another sack [1 sp],
smaller, but sturdy and large enough to hold a
few hundred coins [11 pp, 98 gp, 254 sp, 201 cp].
Finally, at the bottom of the large sack you find
a pair of high leather boots. They are finely
crafted and made from soft, light colored
leather. They would be perfect for riding, and
would provide protection from cold, wet and
muddy surfaces [masterwork boots; 58 gp]. As you
lift the boots out of the sack you hear a sound of
metal on metal coming from within one of the
boots, dumping it out, you discover a small
leather satchel [1 gp]. When you open it you find
a set of pure gold lock picks. The picks are unbelievablly
delicate, such that actually using them
to open locks, could result in damaging them
[195 gp]. [Total 493.71 gp]
61 You find a small silver case with a tiny, intricate
lock [Average lock; case, 90 gp]. Inside the case is
a woman’s vanity set. It contains two small silver
brushes, one with small carved ebony teeth, its
back set with mother of pearl and lapis in an
intricate coat of arms depicting a rampant stag
on a green field [175 gp]. The other brush has
whale ivory teeth and its back is studded with
five small peridots [70 gp]. A set of four hair
combs, made from polished, cut dragon scales
[25 gp each], a small silvered hand mirror [15 gp],
four small crystal phials [5 gp each], and a silver
ring [40 gp], bearing the same coat of arms as the
brush on a small, raised oval, round out the vanity
set. The raised oval has tiny hinges and
opens to reveal an empty compartment [poisoner’s
ring]. [Total 510 gp]
the mother of all treasure tables
52
62 A large chest [2 gp] sits open with its contents
visible. It is loaded with coins, predominantly
silver and copper with a few gold scattered
amongst the mass [178 gp, 1357 sp, 1051 cp].
Sifting through the coins, you find a collection
of additional items. [Note: if the chest is simply
tipped over, several of these items may break.
Pawing roughly through the coins without looking
could result in cuts or scrapes.] Near the top is a
small crystal vial [3 gp] containing a fragrant floral
perfume [8 gp], a small ivory box [4 gp] holding
a few ounces of snuff [2 sp], and a velvet bag
[1 gp] housing a small steel mirror [10 gp] still
polished to a high gloss. Further into the chest,
you spot a small scrap of muslin cloth [1 cp] with
four small fishhooks sticking through it [1 sp
each]. Dispersed throughout the coins are the
pieces of an entire climber’s kit [80 gp] and
enough caltrops to fill three sacks [2 lbs. per sack,
1 gp per sack]. Buried at the bottom, you find four
sunrods [2 gp each], a thunderstone [30 gp] and a
small burlap sack [1 sp] containing eight candles
[1 cp each] and 12 tindertwigs [1 gp each]. Finally,
stuck into the wood of the bottom of the chest
is an ornate kukri with a carved ivory pommel
depicting an attacking manticore [15 gp]. [Total
501 gp]
63 Opening a splintered wooden chest [8 cp], long
missing its latch, you find a fully enclosed gladiator’s
helm. The helm is tarnished bronze, and
displays a roaring tiger as the crest [25 gp].
Beneath the helm, you find a long chainmail
hauberk, made of black steel and some other
metal, now pale green [147 gp]. The hauberk is
studded with bronze flowers, which hang down
the chest like a garland. The chain shirt lies
atop a wooden theater mask which is carved as
a bearded, laughing man with individually
painted grapes in his curly hair [30 gp]. An
unsheathed longsword, with bronze eagle hilt
[25 gp] rests beneath the mask. A pair of sandals
[1 gp], a white linen tunic [6 gp], a deep purple
cloak trimmed in white [19 gp], and a leather
headband studded with small gold circles [35 gp]
are all piled neatly at the bottom of the chest.
Within the pile of clothes, you discover a green
vase which is green and decorated with crawling
vines rendered in precious metals [20 gp] and a
broken oar head which lies atop a carved ivory
box depicting fishermen bringing in the catch
[98 gp]. The small box holds a pair of wool socks
[2 cp], hundreds of silver coins [400 sp], a gold
eagle-head pendant [33 gp], and several gold
pieces [18 gp]. [Total 497.1 gp]
64 There are six cracked jars large enough for children
to hide in. From the remains of simple
black figures, engaged in the growing of grapes
and the making of wine, which are upon the jars
you can tell that they must have once been
beautiful. However, they are now faded and
cracked and very fragile. One of these jars is
actually broken, with one side completely missing.
A mixture of silver, copper, and gold coins
have spilled from the broken place and are now
piled around the base of the urn [220 gp, 2321
sp, 4732 cp]. The other jars are empty, but none
of them appear strong enough to be moved.
[Total 499.42 gp]
65 Two large barrels [2 gp each] rest in the corner.
As you approach them you see they both have
sealed lids. After breaking the seal and opening
the lid on the first barrel you see it is filled with
a reddish liquid. [If someone tastes the liquid or
does something to determine what the liquid is:] You
find the liquid is red wine and it appears to still
be drinkable and quite tasty [equivalent of 40 bottles
of fine wine in this barrel; 385 gp]. You break
the seal on the other barrel, expecting to possibly
find more wine. Instead you find the barrel is
filled with copper and silver coins [573 sp, 6,207
cp]. [Total 508.37 gp]
66 This room has cabinets built into the walls. The
cabinets have hinged doors to protect whatever
is held inside. You rifle through the cabinets and
find four interesting boxes. The first box [2 sp]
contains items which would be used by someone
when trying to scale a natural or crafted rock
wall. Pitons, boot tips, gloves, a sturdy leather
harness, a pick, strong ropes and other useful
items fill this climber’s kit [80 gp]. The next box
[2 sp] you find contains several different-sized
chisels, pieces of white chalk, a dirty cloth, and
some finely-crafted hammers. You can tell these
items are carefully crafted and would be the
main tools of a master sculptor [masterwork
sculptor’s tools, 55 gp]. You come to another box
[2 sp] in a different cabinet and open it to find
many types of herbs, salves, bandages, and cloth
strips. [healer’s kit; 50 gp]. You find one final box
[2 sp] in the last cabinet you open. It contains
two large magnifying glasses [125 gp each], 40
sheets of plain paper [4 sp each], 3 pounds of sealing
wax [1 gp each], and a pouch of coins [38 gp,
77 sp, 28 cp]. [Total 500.78 gp]
67 Inside a well oiled redwood violin case [15 gp],
you discover a fabulous musical instrument. The
violin inside [140 gp] is made of the same dark,
heavy, iridescent wood and has taut and waxed
catgut strings and bronze fittings. The back of
the violin has been engraved with the notes to
several stirring classical pieces. Several spare
strings [6 strings, 2 sp each], charcoal pencils [4,
table IV: 500 gold pieces
53
1 sp each], and closely written pages of music [20
pages, 1 gp each] are stored under a cloth in the
bottom of the case. The violin case has been
placed atop a trio of books bound in pebbled
brown leather [blank spellbooks, 15 gp each]. A
belt pouch [1 gp] lying nearby holds some fanciful
fishing lures made from wood and feathers [4
lures; 3 cp each], a heavy bronze church key [5
gp], and a gold bracelet decorated with tiny
multi-colored tiles, which run in parallel shafts
down the length of the bangle [50 gp].
Additionally, you uncover a square-faced gold
signet ring [45 gp]; the seal on the face is an
abstract pattern of circles and triangles. The
pouch also holds nine flat ring-shaped platinum
coins, and a smooth cube of grey hematite [43
gp] which is cool to the touch. An assortment of
silver coins and small bronze coins, all stamped
with a crown and scimitar, round out the hoard
[bronze coins, worth about the same as copper coins;
310 sp, 800 bp]. [Total 494.72 gp]
68 After several minutes of searching fruitlessly for
treasure or items of value [or walking out of the
abandoned room], you slam the door behind you
only to hear a slight tinkling sound. Intrigued,
you investigate the door itself. You find a lower
panel which can be removed and inside is an
excellent hiding place for a cache of precious
things. Peering in, you can see three bags and,
pulling them out, realize one has the happy heft
and jingle of cold, hard cash. Opening that bag
first, you find gold along with some silver pieces
[97 gp, 17 sp]. The second bag is sealed with a
twist of twine but you soon have that off and
empty out four small cloth bundles which, when
the cloth is removed, you see four thumb-high
crystal statues depicting the Four Winds [50 gp
each]. The third bag is a little smaller than the
other two and contains a flat, narrow wooden
box with a carved lid depicting a skull and crossbones.
Inside the box is an ivory smoking pipe
with an engraving of a typical pirate’s head, and
a parrot on the stem [pipe and box, 200 gp]. [Total
498.7 gp]
69 You find a red canvas backpack [5 gp] with a
bewildering array of pockets, tied on pouches
and bronze-fastened flaps. One of the dangling
pouches contains four lime-green vials, each the
size of a finger, which contain smelling salts [or
some other pungent medicines, 15 gp each].
Another bound-on pouch contains a waxed
envelope filled with valuable seeds [5 gp] and a
small gold lucky charm [16 gp], which might be a
bee if you look at it correctly. One of the outer
pockets contains a bone-handled dagger with a
black steel blade, acid etched with occult runes
[35 gp], and a ceramic hand-bowl glazed dark
blue and covered with matching runes [15 gp].
The bowl is wrapped in a piece torn from an old
crazy-quilt. A large pocket on the other side of
the pack holds a stoppered glass beaker filled to
the brim with valuable spices [90 gp], so potent
the mother of all treasure tables
54
they make your eyes [and mouth] water. Inside
the pack itself, you find three pairs of short linen
trousers [2 gp each], all brownish yellow, an amber
macramÈ shawl decorated with bird skulls, finger
bones and bronze bells [15 gp], and a few pair of
underclothes [1 gp]. Wrapped inside the clothing,
you discover an ivory flute with a gold endcap
[92 gp], a small leather folio of female nudes,
rendered in watercolors [55 gp], and a fist-sized
silver nugget [112 gp]. [Total 507 gp]
70 Judging from its shape, the item in the corner
under the dustsheet is an armchair of some sort.
However, you take a quick peak anyway, and
find that in the cushion’s place is, a stout strongbox.
The box is a forearm’s length long and most
of that wide and high and looks reassuringly
heavy. Unfortunately, the box is locked and
there is no key [Simple lock; strongbox, 13 gp or 2
gp if the lock or lid are destryed when opening it.
Magic, lockpicking skills or brute force and a very
thin and strong blade should do the trick. Once it is
unlocked read:] The box contains a great deal of
silk cloth acting as some kind of covering. Safely
protected by the silk is a set of six tea cups and
saucers of finest porcelain [set 132 gp], together
with six solid silver teaspoons [30 gp set] and a
teapot, decorated with gold leaf and a delightfully
painted scene of a stream running through
a garden [value 250 gp]. Finally, inside the teapot
is a packet of the very best quality tea [25 gp].
The silk itself is of some value because it is of a
good quality and has a bold purple-and-orange
striped pattern [50 gp]. [Total 510 gp]
71 An old wooden handcart [55 gp], sized for a
strong man to pull, holds a variety of mason’s
tools, and has been reinforced with iron wheels
and axles, the better to carry enormous loads.
The wagon sits with its handles pointed to the
sky because of the massive weight at the rear. The
bed of the small cart is dominated by a single
massive slab of marble, as pure white as a fresh
snow bank, banded with soft pink veins. [The slab
is worth 296 gp to a mason, but weighs more than a
war-horse in full barding.] Canvas work-sacks hold
several iron-headed hammers, in varying sizes, an
assortment of wooden mallets with soft, round
heads, and a few iron pickaxes. A smaller canvas
sack holds an assortment of wood and iron awls,
steel rasps, heavy bronze hooks fine enough to
etch small details into the stone, and several
rough ‘rubbing rags’ used to smooth out imperfections
in the stone [masterwork mason’s tools; 55
gp]. Two lengthy coils of copper wire, wrapped
around wooden dowels, have been tossed among
the tools [5 gp each]. A wooden strongbox [with
peeling green paint] [2 gp] holds a quick sketch of
a gravestone commemorating a long-dead noble,
a few charcoal pencils, and more valuable contents.
Inside the box, you find a pale green malachite
[15 gp], a thumb-nail sized piece of obsidian
[19 gp], and gold and platinum coins [3 pp, 20 gp].
[Total 502 gp]
72 A battered leather knapsack [which has been
stitched and patched dozens of times, in a variety of
colors; 2 sp] sits forgotten all by itself. A heavy
bastard sword [70 gp], with a blade of red-tinged
steel, has been tied to one of the sack’s shoulder
straps. The massive sword’s simple hilt has been
capped with a laughing skull, cast in bronze.
Opening the bag, you pull out a pair of steel
beaver traps [20 gp each]; though polished to a
mirror sheen, the traps still stink of musk. A
tightly-rolled leather bundle conceals a supply
of fragrant black pipeweed, as heavy as a wellfed
housecat [50 gp]. At the bottom of the pack,
you discover a red silk scarf, decorated with blue
leaf patterns [12 gp], wrapped protectively
around a crudely-carved soapstone idol of a
plump fertility goddess [50 gp]. An outer pocket
holds a bronze horse’s bridle, with end caps
resembling a sideways figure eight [8 gp], a golden
cloak-clasp molded in the shape of a rampant
bear [50 gp], a silver torque with ends like
clenched fists [60 gp], a dirt-crusted pickaxe [1
gp], a few broken spear heads and stone arrow
heads [no value], and a hinged pine case [6 gp].
Inside the case, you find forms to hold a flute,
which instead hold a variety of valuable items.
There are a pair of horseshoe-shaped gold earrings,
each with a small carnelian [82 gp], gold
coins stamped with lotus blossoms [60 gp], and
mixed copper, bronze and silver coins [47 sp, 72
cp, 8 bp; bronze coins are worth a cp each]. [Total
494.7 gp]
73 Four weapons, some jewelry and three bags have
been tossed upon some colorful cloth. The jewelry
appears to be of the greatest value and consists
of two torcs of twisted gold with animalhead
decorations on the ends. One of these is for
the neck and has a boar’s head on its ends [120
gp]. The other torc is for the arm with wolf-head
ends [65 gp]. Next to these lie three longswords
[10 gp each] and a battleaxe [6 gp]. Investigating
the three bags [3 sp each] reveals they each have
a long woven cord forming a drawstring to allow
them to be carried over the shoulder. Each bag
contains a mixture of gold, silver, and copper
coins [bag 1: 54 gp, 284 sp, 260 cp; bag 2: 75 gp,
221 sp, 290 cp; bag 3: 66 gp, 233 sp, 70 cp]. The
cloth proves to be three colorful capes made
from a fine wool done in a twill weave pattern.
One of these capes is red [1 gp], one is blue with
table IV: 500 gold pieces
55
a yellow geometric design woven into it [16 sp]
and the third has a small rip with blood around
it, but the cape is maroon in color so the stain is
not too noticeable [8 sp]. Each cloak has a simple
brass cloak pin still in it [1 sp each]. [Total
500.6 gp]
74 A whole backpack, down to the shoulder straps,
has been made from tightly fastened links of
gleaming black steel [72 gp] and decorated with
long red and grey ribbons inscribed with prayers.
Inside the unusual backpack, you find three
loaves of fresh bread [3 cp], a bottle of bubbly
white champagne [15 gp], and a complete silver
table setting with utensils [92 gp] wrapped in
black linen. Each of the three exquisitely carved
utensils has a hooked end. Four yellow ceramic
plates are wrapped in leather, and each is decorated
with a green-and-black map of a different
kingdom [5 gp each]. A floor-length wolf pelt
robe with green velvet accents and bronze buttons
[83 gp] is folded beside the chainmail pack.
In one of the robe’s voluminous pockets, you discover
flint and steel [1 gp], a small filleting knife
[2 gp] and a woven leather coin purse [1 sp].
Inside the purse, you find a stag brooch which is
black onyx set against white clay [55 gp], an
hourglass-shaped cloak clasp made of dense silver
[40 gp] and more than a hundred gold coins
minted with the busts of kings and princes wearing
antler crowns [129 gp]. [Total 509.19 gp]
75 You find a box [2 sp] containing a light repeating
crossbow of blond wood [250 gp] and a box
of bolts for it [20 bolts, 4 gp]. Nearby, sitting on
a shield [10 gp] is a black felt hat with a moderate
brim [8 sp] and a heavy gray woolen shirt [2
sp]. The shield is wood, its center and edges of
black iron. Leering orcish faces are painted on
the wood. Jumbled next to the shield are a plate
and copper spoon [1 sp]; a comb [50 gp]; a ribbon
[8 gp] and a heavy horse’s brush [1 gp]. The comb
is carefully carved of ivory, with its teeth intact.
On the back, the ivory has been shaped into
flower-like swirls. The ribbon is as wide as your
hand and is embroidered with complex flowers
in red, yellow and orange. It is long enough to go
around a substantial waist. In a red leather
pouch [6 sp] you find an oval locket on a fine
gold chain and some coins [chain, 25 gp; locket,
100 gp; 3 pp, 11 gp, 45 sp, 58 cp]. The locket
opens to show a well painted miniature portrait
of a lovely young woman. [Total 495.98 gp]
76 You uncover a colorful wool valise [25 gp] under
a pile of moldering blankets. Dark green and
burgundy rose bushes have been embroidered
onto the opulent traveling case’s cloth sides. An
outside pocket holds a palm-sized portfolio [84
gp]. The small wooden book is secured by an
intricate brass lock [Good lock] in the shape of a
coiled serpent [If the lock is opened, you find the
book contains tiny pen and ink landscapes of relevant
places]. A dark green silk choker, studded
with golden buttons [20 gp] is tucked underneath
the book. Opening the case, you find a
pair of linen breeches with red piping, fastened
at the waist with thirteen gold buttons marked
with a cross shape [45 gp]. The breeches lie atop
a conical blue steel helm [75 gp]. The helm’s
beak-like visor covers the wearer’s face completely,
with only an eye slit and several air holes
left unarmored. The helmet’s sloping skullcap
and pointed beak have been inlaid with golden
spirals. The helmet partially covers a black silk
cape [150 gp], complete with veiled hood. Eight
small obsidian beads and tiny carvings of rats
dangle from the veil. Tangled in the cloak is a
white linen coin purse closed by a simple leather
drawstring [1 gp]. The purse contains a silver
fork with a dancing fairy on the handle [8 gp], a
hexagonal bronze ring set with a triangular
hematite [34 gp], and a pile of oval gold and silver
coins [57 gp, 50 sp]. [Total 503 gp]
77 A round and very tarnished chest made of light
copper [20 gp] rises nearly to your knees. Once
the lid is lifted clear, you realize whatever treasure
may lie within is concealed under a year’s
ration of ancient pinto beans [1 gp]. Sifting the
beans, you discover a solid gold idol [210 gp], as
tall as a man’s outstretched hand. The idol displays
a shapely, multilimbed goddess with a falcon’s
head; she dances within a circle of flames,
all cast from solid gold. A folded piece of parchment
sealed with yellow wax holds an anklet of
interlaced triangles, joined in a delicate silver
matrix [90 gp]; the seal on the wax belongs to a
noble house which fell centuries ago. The anklet
is so expertly made, it appears on casual inspection,
to be a single piece of silver; its true nature
is only revealed as it moves. A steel machete
with a tortoise-shell handle [19 gp], and a dozen
two-pronged silver forks [2 gp each] have been
mixed in with the dusty beans. Also scattered
through the beans are a gold ring set with a lapis
lazuli [25 gp], a slim silver ring missing its stone
[5 gp], a simple anklet of knotted gold [45 gp],
two bracelets made from interwoven bands of
wood and brass [5 gp each], and a gold necklace
made to look like intertwined serpents [52 gp].
[Total 501 gp]
78 Looking around, you do not immediately notice
anything of value [unless the room has appropriate
furniture – chairs, desk, etc.]. There is no chest
full of gold, no gleaming magic weapons or
the mother of all treasure tables
56
armor, and no shimmering jewelry. Then your
eyes come to rest on the painting hanging from
the wall. The frame is made of a very light-hued
wood, almost red in color. The painting itself is
of a bloody battle. Knights on large warhorses
charge into battle against a group of immense
giants and the realism of the painting is stunning.
The knights are not smiling, with jaunty
plumes of feathers sticking out of their shining
helmets. Instead they look haggard, with dented
armor and stern, resolved faces. Their horses are
stained with dirt and blood, and some are visibly
injured. The giants are gruesome to behold and
blood can be seen splattered on the grass where
the battle is taking place. Although there is no
signature to indicate who the artist may be, the
striking quality of this painting is a rare find
indeed. [This painting is by an exceptional, very
well known artist, but very different from his or her
usual style; 488 gp.] [Total 488 gp]
79 Two burgundy leather cloaks [3 gp each] have
been stitched together to make an improvised
bag, which opens like an enormous purse. A
thick fur coat [190 gp] has been laid carefully
inside. The heavy coat is the pure white of new
snow, and the lining is fiery orange velvet.
Mushroom-shaped brass buttons hold the coat
closed. A heavy oak walking staff [125 gp] has
been wrapped up in the luxurious coat. The
crooked staff is as tall as a man, and has been
carved into a miniature river bed. Hundreds of
wooden vipers twine their way through basrelief
weeds. The head of the staff has been
shaped into a crocodile with a gaping, fanged
mouth. A pink pearl [100 gp] drips from one of
the crocodile’s jagged teeth. Inside one of the
coat’s pockets, you discover a small purse, decorated
by green and black glass beads [25 gp].
Inside the purse are a pair of “T-shaped” gold
earrings [24 gp], a tiny, wickedly sharp silver
knife [used for manicures, 5 gp], a shield-shaped
mother of pearl brooch [15 gp] with a silver
frame, a gold thumb ring resembling knotted
rope [10 gp] and several rectangular golden coins
[9 gp]. [Total 509 gp]
80 You discover a mid-size pine traveling case [5
gp]; grape vine patterns have been burned deep
into the soft wood, and the case rattles noisily.
Opening the case, you find a scrap of old bedding,
wrapped around six glass vials of vibrantly
colored paint [made from pressed flowers and
crushed gemstones 15 gp each]. Beside the paint,
you find a small leather pouch [5 gp] containing
nearly a score of sewing needles of varying
lengths and thicknesses [10 gp]. A clay jar the
size of an egg holds a potent painkilling salve [20
gp] which smells strongly of mold and peppermint.
A dirty leather pouch [8 gp] contains a few
scraps of parchment [4 sp], a vial of ink [8 gp],
and an ink pen [1 sp]. The bottom of the case is
filled with a dizzying assortment of small religious
medallions; every major faith and quite a
few obscure ones are represented. Some are
cheap wood or simple stone icons, but others are
statements of faith made in gold and bronze. [75
wooden icons, 2 sp each; 36 stone icons, 5 sp each;
57 bronze medallions, 1 gp each; 49 gold medallions,
5 gp each; total 335 gp] Mixed in with the
medallions are the heads of seven iron cattle
brands, which have been snapped off at their
hilts [5 sp each]. A leather pouch [1 gp] contains
a rhodochrosite [10 gp] and a small freshwater
pearl [6 gp]. [Total 502 gp]
81 At first you did not notice the shelf set so high
on the wall it is almost flush with the ceiling. [If
outside, this could be hidden inside a hollow tree or
placed in a waterproof skin, weighed down with
stones and concealed in a stream or lake]. Tucked
away there, you find a long jewelled scabbard
[175 gp], of a suitable size for a longsword but
without the weapon. The scabbard is studded
with hundreds of tiny rhinestones to create the
image of thirteen swans swimming on a lake.
Inside the scabbard are 17 tiny ingots of pure
platinum rattling around, each one about the
size of a coin [17 gp each]; together with a roll of
parchment which extends from one end of the
scabbard. It is a very thinly wrapped piece of
parchment which, when carefully unrolled,
reveals what seems to be a treasure map [The
map point to a location close at hand. Its level of
accuracy is at your discretion. In either case, it will
sell for 150 gp to suitable adventurers or speculators].
[Total 495 gp]
82 A silk bag with a golden drawstring bears a gold
eagle crest upon it and is obviously of noble
quality [10 gp]. This small bag holds a collection
of gems and a handful of platinum pieces [12 pp].
There are three glistening gems of light blue
about the size of a large pea [blue quartz, 10 gp
each], and one gem of purest black which is
slightly larger than the blue ones. Its deep black
color almost draws you into its depths with its
beauty [obsidian, 40 gp]. A small but beautiful
deep violet stone flashes in the light and is the
finest of the collection [violet garnet, 300 gp].
[Total 500 gp]
83 You find an ornate, carved wooden desk [100 gp]
and matching chair [35 gp] resting against the
wall. Sitting on the corner of the desk is an old
merchant’s scale which looks functional despite
its apparent age [2 gp]. Sitting on one of the
table four: 500 gold pieces
57
scale arms is an hourglass [25 gp], smudged and
dirty but unbroken. There are five drawers in
the desk; two on the left, two on the right, and
one in the middle. The top left drawer holds a
set of ivory pens [masterwork calligraphy pens, 55
gp] and three vials of ink [8 gp each]. The deeper
bottom drawer contains forty sheets of parchment
[2 sp each]. The center drawer rattles with
loose coins of various sizes, metals, and mintings
[2 pp, 34 gp, 96 sp, 126 cp]. On the right side,
the top drawer holds a lump of yellowish sealing
wax [1/2 pound, 5 sp] and a wooden block [5 gp].
Carved into the end of the block is a signet featuring
a fleur-de-lis over crossed swords. Behind
these, in the back of the drawer is an ornate,
ivory map case [130 gp] with five small pink crystals
[rose quartz] set along the side. The final
deep drawer holds 10 bolts [1 gp]. When you
move the desk you find a heavy crossbow [50 gp].
[Total 500.36 gp]
84 A tooth-shaped, black shoulder bag [48 gp] has
been embellished with dizzying beadwork; yellow
and red beads make abstract flowers, while
the lip of the purse is covered in red, yellow,
blue, white and green beads in circular displays.
A quiver [32 gp], beaded to match the bag holds
two score of red-fletched arrows [4 gp], and a collection
of loose arrowheads [2 gp], all decorated
by painted-on animal motifs. Inside the bag, you
find a long stemmed wooden pipe [25 gp], the
end of which is a crouching warrior in an ornate,
feathered helm. You pull a heavy sculpture [85
gp] out of the bag, a massive lump of amber sandstone,
hewn into a squatting male figure; blue
paint across the figure’s face forms intricate tattoos.
A small gold necklace made of toothshaped
segments [60 gp] has been hung around
the statue’s stubby neck. A curving club [29 gp],
carved from an antler and hung with bells, yellow
twine and colorful fetishes is also stuffed
into the pack. One of the fetishes is an expertlymade
human figure, rendered in red and black
cloth, wearing a man’s silver and amber ring as a
‘belt’ [155 gp]. A hollowed-out gourd [2 sp] holds
cowrie shells [18 shells, no value as money but
potential value to a collector], tiny gold coins in
the shape of a hand [58 coins, 1 gp each to collectors],
and a few standard silvers [27 sp]. [Total
500.7 gp]
85 You notice a square hole at the very top of one
wall of the room. As you approach you see the
hole is about a foot high and wide, but it is too
high up to see if it contains anything. [After the
adventurers figure out a way to get to the hole:] The
first thing you discover is a leather satchel [1 gp]
resting inside the hole. As you remove it you see
another leather satchel [1 gp] was sitting right
behind the first. After retrieving both bags you
open the first to find it full of gold [218 gp].
When you open the second you observe six large
round loops made of different materials. Two are
made of gold, two are made of silver, one is made
of copper, and the last is made of what looks like
common iron. [These are actually rings made to fit
the fingers of a very large giant; it is up to the game
master to determine if the adventurers can discern
this fact. The two gold rings, 83 gp each; two silver
rings, 48 gp each; one copper ring, 17 gp; one iron
ring, 7 gp]. [Total 506 gp]
86 Three large vases [each one 3 feet tall, 5 gp each]
sit near the wall to the left of you. You examine
them and are not very impressed with their quality.
You look inside hoping to find some treasure,
but each one is empty. [If the adventurers decide to
take the vases, or move them:] As you move the
vases from their resting place you notice there is
a hole dug into the floor under where each vase
was sitting. In the first hole you find a large
mound of silver coins [1,459 sp]. You look inside
the second hole to find a smaller pile of gold
coins [187 gp]. Finally you look inside the third
hole and see nothing but loose dirt [or: stone
chips; a dark hole]. [If someone digs at the dirt:] You
dig away the loose dirt and find something
buried underneath. [or: You feel around the hole
until you find something solid.] You lift it out and
dust it off to discover a small box made of solid
gold. It has etchings on it depicting a forest
glade with an eagle flying overhead [144 gp]. You
open the box to reveal a sequined kerchief made
of silk [8 gp]. [Total 499.9 gp]
87 You see rotten sacks literally bursting with coin.
Small bugs, which can still be seen in the sacks,
seem to have been eating them. The sacks
themselves can no longer support the weight of
the coins and any attempt to move them makes
the tears larger. Amid the remains of the sacks
are a large number of coins. You estimate that
there are over a thousand copper pieces, about
that number of silver, and a few hundred gold
pieces [340 gp, 1,472 sp, 1,287 cp]. Within one
of the sacks you also find a stick charcoal [3cp]
and a piece of papyrus [4 sp] that inventories the
amounts. [Total 500.5 gp]
88 A badly scored and damaged oak wardrobe [5
gp], missing one of its stubby triangular legs, lies
on its back. The wardrobe has been stuffed with
a motley assortment of old clothes. Amid the
colorful but moth-eaten rags, you find a well
preserved wedding dress of lucky red cotton [185
gp; cotton is a rare and valuable foreign cloth].
Helix patterns, rendered in white bead work,
the mother of all treasure tables
58
and set off by small pearls, chase up the dress’
long train. A diaphanous veil and ruffled underskirts,
all well preserved, are piled beside the
dress. [No other clothing of value is found.]
Beneath the moldering finery, you find a small
hexagonal iron shield with a golden scythe bolted
to its dented face [65 gp]. Nearby, you find a
black iron labrdis [double bladed axe, 142 gp]
inlaid with gold so it resembles a monarch butterfly
spreading is wings. Gold bands wind down
the heavy weapon’s long hilt, and end in a knobby
gold pommel. Beside the fanciful axe, you
find a war horn [30 gp] carved from the tusk of
some great boar. A hunting scene has been
carved into the trumpet’s smooth flank in low
relief. Deeper into the pile, you find three identical
square green glass bottles of liquid [two bottles
of brandy, 21 gp each, and one bottle of champagne,
32 gp]. [Total 501 gp]
89 A trio of large woven baskets [4 sp each] sits on
the floor. The baskets look worn, as if they have
been used heavily and frequently. The middle
basket has a large handle which has been
repaired at least once. Of the three, it is also the
dirtiest, coated with a thick, grayish dust. It is
overflowing with rocks the size of a fist. The
rocks have been chipped out of a cave or tunnel
wall and are slate gray. However, each has ribbons
of gold running through it [unrefined gold
ore, 20 pounds, 15 gp per pound, 300 gp total].
Buried under the rocks are five shiny silver
stones the size of a thumbnail [hematite, 10 gp
each] and three equally shiny black stones which
are half as large [onyx, 20 gp each]. A second basket
holds the owner’s tools: a miner’s pick which
has seen a lot of use but is still serviceable [3 gp],
a hooded lantern coated with the same gray dust
as the middle basket and currently empty of fuel
[7 gp], and four pints of lamp oil in thick glass
jars [1 sp each]. The final basket holds a large
collection of loose coins which appears to be
roughly equal amounts of copper and silver [731
sp, 778 cp]. [Total 502.48 gp]
90 You see a large leather bag and two smaller
sacks. The leather bag [35 gp] has a leather
shoulder strap and appears to be made from the
skin of an otter, but it would have been much
larger than any otter you have ever seen. The fur
is still intact and used on the outside of the bag
and the strap. Inside the bag is a stiff black
leather belt [120 gp], about six inches wide, set
with shiny pieces of silver in irregular geometric
shapes. Each metal piece is no larger than a fingernail,
but thick lines of them loop up and
down the length of the belt, which fastens with
a square silver buckle. There are two matching
wristlets fastened with small dual buckles [25 gp
each]. Also in this bag is a beaver pelt [4 gp]. One
cloth sack contains a small iron pot [3 sp], a
wooden bowl [5 cp], a cup [5 cp], some wooden
utensils [6 cp], and a couple pieces of jerky
which seem to be edible [2 cp]. In the other bag
you find several hundred coins [235 gp, 540 sp,
and 48 cp]. [Total 498.96 gp]
91 Inside an old oak keg painted purple and
detailed by whitish spider webs [2 gp], you
uncover an odd collection of toys and games.
The barrel holds a rainbow assortment of glass
marbles; some of the larger marbles have dried
insects, small flowers, or coins embedded in the
glass [120, 1 gp each]. Finding anything else
involves digging through the densely packed
marbles. A pair of blunt wooden short swords
with elaborately carved hilts and gilding, now
rather chipped [75 gp each] rest within matching
green and black leather scabbards, each personalized
with a boy’s name; one sword evidently
belonged to Matteo, its counterpart to Antonio.
A heavy wooden game set [20 gp], carved from
white pine and knobby black teak, is stuffed
down into the keg. The pieces for the game are
stored in a latched compartment on the underside
of the game board; five gold coins have
been hidden there as well. A realistic stuffed
wolf [7 gp], sewn out of black rabbit fur, chases a
red felt bear [2 gp] through the marbles. There is
also an intricate and fully posable wooden hydra
puppet, painted a fierce black, and adorned with
24 tiny blue crystal eyes [140 gp]. A book of children’s
prayers with a gold foil cover [10 gp] has
been marred by inky splotches. Somewhere
amid the marbles, you find a pastel blue woman’s
purse [5 sp]. The small handbag bulges with long
silver coins [450 sp]. [Total 496.5 gp]
92 A colorfully painted pushcart [30 gp] has been
overturned and the contents spilled out. Its rainbow-
colored wheels are still intact, and spin lazily
when jostled. Red and orange banners lie
about. Eight two-pound bags of salt, each in an
individual linen sack lined with waxed paper, lie
strewn about [10 gp each]. Also present are two
larger sacks of flour [5 lbs each, 1 sp each] and
bags of spices – cinnamon [2 lbs, 2 gp]; ginger [2
lbs, 4 gp]; cloves [2 lbs, 30 gp] and pepper [2 lbs,
4 gp]. A rat has been at the flour, and tiny white
footprints lead back to its lair. [If the flour is used
or sold, illness could result in those that consume it.
Plague could result if fleas are found in the sacks.]
Hundreds of individually wrapped sweets [mostly
sticky concoctions of honey and nuts] have been
tossed down around the wrecked cart. The
insects have either eaten or contaminated neartable

ly all the candies and only the brilliant wrappers
remain. Two heavy glass jars [2 gp each] with
tight cork stoppers hold tea [3 lbs, 3 gp] and
pipeweed [4 lbs, 2 gp] and four slender bottles
contain orange champagne [60 gp total]. Each of
the wine bottles is stopped by a molded ceramic
cat, sealed with wax [22 gp total]. An old brass
tea-kettle [2 gp] holds some of the merchant’s
fortune. Two identical brooches have been hidden
inside; both are autumn trees, etched into
silver oval and flecked with tigereye and
rhodochrosite chips as ‘leaves’ [83 gp each]. An
ivory pendant resembles an hourglass, and is
speckled with tiny golden dots like sand [20 gp].
Below these, the kettle is filled with a jangling
collection of coins [45 gp, 186 sp, 397 cp]. [Total
496.77 gp]
93 There is a long, octagonal chest made of
mahogany and fastened with tarnished iron
clasps [80 gp]. Each of the four clasps is fashioned
to look like a grotesque, grinning face.
Within the chest you find several bolts of
cream-colored silk, edged with vibrant crimson
velvet piping [295 gp]. You also find a smaller
box [30 gp], shaped identically to the larger one,
made of ebony and inlaid with a pattern of
pyramidal bone tiles, each dyed indigo blue. The
clasps on the small box are plain, but here there
is a tiny iron lock [simple lock, 20 gp] shaped like
a grinning face, with a tiny brass skeleton key
protruding from its mouth. Within the smaller
box is a tiny game board [5 gp] carved of bone.
The board is inlaid with a geometric pattern of
alternating ebony and mother of pearl tiles. The
board’s tiles are very worn and scratched, as if
the game has been played countless times
before. In a second compartment of the smaller
box are ten tiny game pieces [70 gp total] made of
ebony and deep red coral, and sculpted to look
like miniature wolves and tigers. Coins are scattered
along the bottom of the larger of the box
[4 gp, 12 sp, 60 cp]. [Total 506.8 gp]
94 An old fishing net, still stinking of kelp and tuna
[1 gp] has been used to gather an assortment of
different jars close together. A ceramic flask [13
gp] is covered in fiery red lacquer and decorated
with peonies. Inside this flask, triangular chips of
brown and white eye agate have been stuffed
down into dirty woollen batting [11 pieces, 2 gp
each]. A dragon gourd, whose tail is the handle,
has been glazed green-grey [15 gp] and holds
about three pounds of aromatic, bitter tea leaves
[3 gp]. A small silver spoon [8 gp] has been stuffed
down into the leaves. A matched pair of blue
and white vases [15 gp each], glazed with looping
arrow patterns, holds a few small jewelled items.
One vase contains a tangled string of polished
wooden prayer beads [bamboo, 52 gp], inscribed
with the names of gods, which stretches as long
as a tall man, and a smooth onyx ring [184 gp].
The vase also holds a black lacquer bracelet [49
gp] featuring a dragon with gilded scales and
mother of pearl eyes and a tiny malachite cow
pendant on a slender golden chain [78 gp ]. The
second vase holds a silk pouch [2 gp]. The pouch
conceals a chunky gold nugget, still in its stone
matrix [40 gp]. [Total 497 gp]
95 The nest is a foul collection of torn bedding and
soiled clothing, most of it shredded into long,
worthless strips. You can see the hilt of a
greatsword [50 gp] poking out from beneath the
pile. It is in decent condition, if a bit rusty. Next
to the sword is a suit of worn but serviceable
banded mail sized for a large human or half-orc
[250 gp]. A few bones are still lying near the
banded mail, and they show evidence of having
been gnawed on. A backpack lies by the armor;
like the bedding, it has been shredded to worthlessness.
Its contents lie strewn throughout the
pile. A trio of sunrods [2 gp each] are tied together
with a chewed string. The remains of trail
rations are mixed with a destroyed pile of rope
and scraps from a canvas sack. You can gather a
nice stack of coins from those scattered amongst
the refuse [69 gp, 148 sp]. Buried in the back is a
composite shortbow which, surprisingly, shows
no wear save a missing bowstring [75 gp]. A
quiver of arrows is here as well, chewed through,
but still containing three arrows [masterwork
arrows, 6 gp each]. Against the wall is a flask of
alchemist’s fire, amazingly still intact [20 gp].
[Total 502.8 gp]
96 A large iron cooking pot [5 sp] serves as a
makeshift treasure chest. The lid is tied to the
pot with a chain [10 feet; 30 gp] that has been
looped through the lid handle, around the bottom
of the pot, then knotted as well as possible.
Unwinding the chain and lifting the lid, you
find a mass of coins [147 gp, 335 sp, 558 cp] with
a few useful items. Sitting on top is a magnifying
glass; the lens is intact and in good shape, if
dirty, but the handle is cracked [90 gp]. Below
this, buried in the coins, is a small lens contained
in a round, wooden frame [jeweler’s eye
loupe, 45 gp]. At the bottom of the pot is a small
leather drawstring bag [5 sp] which fits easily
into the palm of your hand. It rattles when shaken
or moved, like small pebbles hitting together.
Inside, you find a number of small gemstones,
each one cut and polished. Four of the stones are
small, white and irregular [freshwater pearls, 5 gp
each]. Another five are a lustrous blue and are
the mother of all treasure tables
60
semi-transparent [blue quartz, 10 gp each]. Three
little silver-black stones [hematite, 10 gp each]
and one larger yellowish stone with a white
band [chrysoberyl, 50 gp] complete the collection.
[Total 502.08 gp]
97 You find an ornate jewelry cabinet about a third
the size of a bale of hay [250 gp]. The body of the
cabinet is made of pale ash wood, while its four
drawers are made of a darker wood, perhaps oak
or cherry, and lined with padded silk. Every surface
is covered in scrollwork, with bits of each
part of the design picked out in specks of gold
leaf. Each tiny drawer knob is also covered in
gold. The cabinet shows hardly any wear at all.
The top drawer holds a single item, a tiara made
of three strands of silver wire [160 gp] and set
with a single red stone [garnet]. The second
drawer contains a couple dozen sewing needles,
the tips of which are stuck into blobs of red wax
[32 needles, 5 sp each]. The third drawer is empty,
but in the fourth drawer you find three blocks of
purple sealing wax [1 gp each] and two signet
rings. The first ring is made of brass, with the
design of a sailing ship floating over a manyspired
castle [5 gp]. The second ring is made of
silver, and depicts a line of fire, a man’s dead
body and a broken sword [66 gp]. [Total 500 gp]
98 A cloth mannequin resting on a wooden stand
catches your eye. As you approach you can see it
looks like a tailor’s dummy [5 gp], but it does not
currently hold any type of clothing. Instead
there are several items which appear to be
pinned to it. The largest item draws your attention
first; it is a cloth map of the surrounding
area and it appears to be accurate [11 gp – accurate
as far as the PCs know, based on their knowledge
of the area – the map covers a 25 square mile
area]. Next you see two identical earrings near
the top of the mannequin. They are made of
gold, with tiny diamond chips forming a
teardrop shape [130 gp]. Below the earrings you
notice seven straight pins, each one with a small
pink crystal at the head. The pins appear to be
the type which a woman may use to put her hair
up [silver pins with a rose crystal on top, 12 gp
each]. As you circle around the dummy you find
quite a wondrous thing pinned to the other side.
Gloves that appear to be made of fine leather,
with platinum studs along the sleeve, are fastened
to the mannequin. The gloves are heavy
as you lift them from their perch, and you can
tell that not only are they finely made, but they
will be quite comfortable and warm for the person
who wears them [human-sized gloves, 275 gp].
[Total 505 gp]
99 In the pile [box] is a handaxe with a piece of
smooth dark wood for the haft and runes etched
into the blade [6 gp]. You also find a warhammer
with an angled head and a point at the top of
the haft [13 gp]. There is a hand-sized gold statue
of the god [ess] of the hunt and his [her] faithful
hound [70 gp]. A small box [1 gp] holds a
small greenish statue of a swimming duck [soapstone,
150 gp], a silver vial [5 sp], a piece of fine
white lace, a handspan square [2 gp] and a ring
[150 gp] on a solid brass chain long enough to
wear around the neck [2 gp]. The vial holds an
odd-smelling liquid [cough medicine, 1 sp]. The
ring is silver, and set with a faceted purple stone
the size of a little-finger nail [amethyst]. Next to
the box is an iron lantern with a well made handle
[10 gp]. There is also a book bound in black
leather and tied with a thong. It has about 30
pages of fine paper but nothing written in it.
[blank spellbook, 15 gp]. A fat pouch [5 sp] contains
coins and 3 irregular pearls [38 gp, 131 sp,
35 cp; 3 freshwater pearls, 10 gp each]. [Total
501.55 gp]
100 Inside the oak chest you see what appears to be
clothing. As you remove it from the chest you
discover it is indeed clothing; a dress to be exact
[87 gp]. It is a black dress of exquisite quality. It
looks as if it may have been made for some
solemn event, and it is of a size that makes you
think it was made for a young girl. When you
take your eyes away from the dress and back to
the chest you see coins gleaming freely within
[138 gp, 370 sp]. The dress feels silky and yet
strongly sewn as you lay it down to sift through
the coins. Eventually your hand grabs hold of
something solid which is obviously not a coin.
You pull it out to discover a porcelain doll. The
doll is about a foot long, and it shows no sign of
age, so it may be rather new. It is a young lady
wearing what appears to be an elaborate wedding
dress. The entire doll is made of porcelain, rather
than just the head, a superior item, not the type
of doll that just any little child would receive
[235 gp]. You run your fingers through the coins
again, but find nothing else. [Total 497 gp]
table IV: 500 gold pieces

Good haul. We need a few more
like this!
All sets are valued at 1,000 gold pieces plus or minus
2%, or in other words 980 to 1,020 gp. The italicized text
contains values and information reserved for the game
master. In general, the GM will not immediately read this
text to the players; it is there for the GM to use as he or
she sees fit.
Roll d% and use the indicated set:
01 Against the wall you see a sturdy, dark walnut
headboard for a grand bed [284 gp]; the rest of
the bed is missing. The center of the headboard
would rise at least a cubit above the level of the
bed, and the two corner posts are higher yet.
The posts are a combination of tightly turned
spirals and graduated knobs, while the center
board is a solid piece rising in two grand swirls to
an elegant set of knobs in the center. This carving
looks like it was done by a master. On the
floor below it sits a two-tiered box made of the
same polished wood [14 gp]. The lower section is
rectangular, about a foot long, a handspan wide
and a hands-breadth deep. It is carved with elaborate
knotwork patterns and sits of four small,
round feet. Attached to the top of this is a smaller
box only about a finger-length deep that looks
like a tiny trunk. Inside, wrapped in a piece of
silk [1 gp] is a sturdy gold pin in the shape of a
butterfly [378 gp]. It is elaborately engraved and
the spots on the wings are gems: four small
round green pieces [peridot] and two larger oval
ones, in a tawny gold color [amber]. The top of
the lower box, with the upper box attached, simply
lifts off to reveal the contents: a small mass
of coins [41 gp, 267 sp, 418 cp]. [The small trunk
is not permanently attached to the lower box; with
some effort, it will slide off the long way, revealing a
small hidden space which holds a scrap of wool (2
sp) wrapped around a single large amethyst, 250 gp]
[Total 999.08 gp]
02 In a chest [2 gp] you find a composite horseman’s
[short] bow, its grip wrapped in blue leather [75
gp], a soft leather quiver, painted yellow [2 gp]
holding twenty arrows with yellow and blue
stripes [set, 1 gp] and a well made brown military
saddle [20 gp]. A hinged box about the length of
your foot lies beneath the saddle. It has a brass
handle and closes with a latch. Inside you find
brass scales. The two identical brass pans can be
suspended on the beams, which extend as a ‘T’
above a heavy round brass base. Graduated
weights, from light to heavy, sit in niches made
for them. The case has thick padding, which
holds the scales snugly in the box [30 gp]. A
hooded lantern [7 gp] and three spades, their
handles only as long as their blades [2 gp each],
fill most of the rest of the chest. A fine deepblue
silk cloak is folded and lies across the bottom
of the chest [40 gp] atop a luxurious bear
skin blanket [75 gp]. Tucked into the bearskin is
a red leather pouch [1 gp] containing a couple
hundred coins [33 gp, 120 sp, 274 cp], seven
pieces of onyx [50 gp each], a brooch and a ring.
The brooch is silver, with six carnelians set in
the shape of a red bird [320 gp]. The ring is a
thick copper band with a silver wolf’s head [25
gp]. [Total 1,001.74 gp]
03 You find an enormous wooden chest banded
with black iron [7 gp]. The chest is covered in
deep cuts, as if from sword and axe blows, and it
is held shut by a single broken lock. The lid
opens with a theatrical creak, revealing six
heavy steel shields, each of which sits in its own
wooden frame [20 gp each]. The shields are
painted alike, with the design of a stag over four
quadrants: blue, white, black and dark gray.
They are all pristine save one, which has a single
large dent in its face. Tucked in among the
shields are eight daggers in green leather sheaths
[2 gp each], two heavy maces with wire-wrapped
grips [12 gp each], a warhammer with its striking
surface shaped like a bear’s head [22 gp] and an
exceptionally fine longsword [815 gp]. The
sword’s blade is slightly longer than normal, and
features carvings on both sides. On one side are
the faces of a long line of dwarven kings with
the eldest near the pommel; there is room for a
few more faces at the far end of the blade. On
the other side is a beautifully depicted mountain
range over which hangs a line of heavy rain
clouds. A chunk of amber the size of a grape is
set into the sword’s pommel, and the heartwood
grip is inlaid with thin lines of silver. A perfect
tourmaline is set into each end of the crossguard,
which is shaped like a pair of stout spears
pointing outwards. [Total 1,004 gp]
04 A dozen large wooden barrels [2 gp each] stand
here. Atop them lie a greataxe [20 gp], a light
crossbow [35 gp] and 25 bolts [1 sp each] and two
thick brown blankets [5 sp each]. A large well
Table V:
1,000 Gold Pieces
62
made oak chest [5 gp] sits beside the barrels, and
a sack lies next to it. Four barrels contain mead
[honey wine; 20 gp per barrel], six are filled with a
good local ale [5 gp per barrel], one holds iron
nails [about 1000; 10 gp] and the last one is
stuffed with salt pork [120 gp]. The loose sack
beside the box holds a pair of sandals, each with
a narrow blade of polished iron fastened sharp
side down along the length of the sole [ice skates;
pair 10 gp], a stuffed dog with buttons for eyes
and nose and a braided woolen tail [5 cp], a
clawed hammer [5 sp] and a big wooden mallet
[2 sp]. The chest is latched but not locked.
Opening the lid, you find it is very tightly
packed, holding two big bolts of silk cloth, their
patterns combinations of green and golden yellow
[10 yards each; 10 gp per yard] and two bolts
of green and white wool cloth [10 yards each; 1
gp per yards]. Hidden under the cloth bolts at the
bottom of the chest you find a sharp dagger [2
gp] and a leather sack [2 sp]. The bag contains a
pair of brass statues of sphinxes [130 gp each]
with eyes of onyx, a thin silver ring with a leaf
design running around it [5 gp], a thick, plain
gold ring [20 gp], and many coins [101 gp, 467
sp, 125 cp]. [Total 994.4 gp]
05 You find several moth-eaten bags used to contain
a mixture of coinage. However, the bags are
now so fragile that any attempt to move or open
them only tears greater holes in them. When
handled, the bags disintegrate leaving a pile of
coins of various metals and a black leather
pouch of calf’s hide with a blue suede flap and a
clasp made of polished white mother of pearl.
The clasp is a round button with the figure of a
dove in flight engraved upon it [16 sp]. In the
pouch is a necklace made of hematite chips,
mostly flat but irregular in shape, each smaller
than a lady’s least fingernail. The dark grey bits
are each bored through with a small hole and
strung on silver wire, which is fastened by being
twisted with itself. The necklace is long enough
to be simply put on and off over the head [250
gp]. There is also a gold ring with a twisted leaf
pattern holding a silver pearl [155 gp]. [The coin
comes from a wide variety of mints and places; 32
pp, 213 gp, 516 sp, 1544 cp.] [Total 1006.64 gp]
06 Looking around you spot a freestanding birdcage.
It appears to be made of pure gold and
stands about five feet tall. The four-legged post,
which holds the cage erect, is about three and a
half feet tall; while the cage itself is about a foot
and a half. You notice as you survey the cage, it
does have several scratches on the post and the
cage itself [weigh 16 pounds; 800 gp]. There is
currently no bird or any kind of animal in the
cage, but the door is open and there is a lump of
some kind under the layer of sawdust, which
lines the floor of the enclosure. Sifting through
the dust produces a brilliant, deep-green spinel
[186 gp]. Further searching, alas, reveals nothing.
[Total 986 gp]
07 In a box [or cabinet] you find a matched set of
eight well formed yellow clay cups without handles
[5 sp each], a pair of small open-toed doeskin
sandals with gold buckles [5 gp], a silver box [2
gp] small enough to fit into your palm containing
tiny white crystals [salt; 1 gp], and a hen and
six baby chicks of clay carefully painted in lifelike
colors [2 gp]. A soft oiled-leather box holds
picks, files, tiny pliers and tweezers [thieves’ tools,
30 gp]. A narrow polished wooden box [5 sp]
beside it slides open to reveal jewelry. In it are a
pendant, two rings, a bracelet and a necklace.
The pendant is a clear crystal like a large drop of
water [rock crystal 100 gp] on a complex thin
gold chain [60 gp]. One ring is a gray metal
[pewter] signet ring with a crest [a flaming sword
or GM’s choice; 10 gp], the other is a thin platinum
ring with a sparkling green gem [green
spinel; ring, 400 gp]. The bracelet is a series of
pieces of simple hammered gold linked together
with hinges [120 gp]. The necklace is thick, polished
copper supporting twelve carefully
matched and cut pieces of shiny gray stone
[hematite; necklace 180 gp]. A fat clay pig [3 sp]
with a slit in the top rattles with coins. [The pig
holds 66 gp, 175 sp, 142 cp; the coins cannot be
easily removed without breaking the container.]
[Total 999.72 gp]
08 You find three brass horns, about as long as a
forearm, each engraved with the same coat of
arms [15 gp each; similar to trumpets] and a twobladed
sword [350 gp], the hilt shaped as a diving
eagle holding a big purple gem [amethyst],
lying in front of a black military saddle with
gilded trim [25 gp]. A round box of thin wood
covered with patterned silk [hatbox, 2 sp] is tied
with green ribbon [2 cp]. Inside is a formal lady’s
hat made of satin and covered with white feathers
[2 gp]. Under it are silk ribbons (red, yellow,
orange, white, mauve and lavender) rolled up
together, long enough for tying hair and not
much else [2 sp each], a wooden duck with
wheels on a long string [5 cp], a pair of thick blue
woolen mittens [5 cp] and two leather pouches.
The first pouch [1 sp] contains strips of dried
meat [5 sp] and a mix of roasted nuts and dried
fruit [2 sp]. The second pouch [2 sp] is heavy
with coins [4 pp, 74 gp, 218 sp, 54 cp]. Amid the
coins you find three fine red bloodstones [50 gp
each]. In a corner at the bottom of the round box
lie a walnut and a silver ring [110 gp] with a
bright red stone [red spinel]. [Upon closer inspectable
V: 1,000 gold pieces
63
tion, the walnut is a small box carved of single piece
of wood in the shape of a walnut. The lid is concealed
in the wrinkles. In the walnut is a particularly
fine, tiny piece of amber cut in the shape of tiger;
180 gp.] [Total 1,000.86 gp]
09 In the treasure you find a tall gray flail [8 gp], a
horseman’s composite shortbow with the grip
wrapped in red leather and the bowstring dyed
red [75 gp] and a compact quiver with twenty
arrows, unpainted and fletched with gray goose
feathers [set 1 gp]. A brown leather shoulder pack
[5 sp] holds a pair of gauntlets made of thick
pigskin, reinforced with iron, for very small
hands [3 gp], a thin flexible dagger [2 gp], and a
whetstone [2 cp]. There are several fine pieces of
parchment paper, rolled up and tied with a
leather thong [15 sheets, 2 sp each]. Below the
paper, carefully protected by three leather cases
[2 sp each] and braced against the bottom of the
pack are three vials of expensive ink, red, green
and blue [9 gp each]. A leather-wrapped parcel
[leather wrapping; 2 sp] lies behind the pack, and
beside it is a small metal box. Gold, silver and
copper coins are scattered on the ground [7 gp,
119 sp, 766 cp]. You unwrap the parcel to reveal
nine items, each carefully wrapped in strips of
light brown wool. There are four vials, cut of
rock crystal with tight-fitting rock crystal stoppers
[80 gp each] and five gold spoons [soupspoon
size, 15 gp each]. The box is copper, with handsome
curling designs pounded into the sides and
top [2 gp]. The lid is hinged and closed with a
latch. Inside, a gold ring with letters inscribed in
it [someone’s initials, perhaps; 18 gp] lies atop a silver
and rose quartz necklace [8 pieces of rose
quartz; necklace, 450 gp]. A leather bag, split
open along the seams lies behind the leather
pack, empty but for six copper pieces [bag, as is,
no value]. [Total 1,011.94 gp]
10 A messy nest of sorts is piled in the corner of the
room, made mostly of a huge pile of uncoiled
and shredded hemp rope. Searching through it
causes tiny fibers to fly into the air making a
choking dust. Poking out of the pile is a pair of
small tridents sized for a halfling or gnome [15 gp
each], one of which has dried blood on its points.
A suit of chainmail [masterwork, 300 gp], also
sized for a gnome, lies buried under a pile of
shredded and filthy blankets. You also locate the
contents of a backpack. The pack itself is here in
dozens of bits and pieces, but some of the items
it carried are still in good shape. A small box
with flint and steel [1 gp] and a pair of torches [1
cp each] rest in the pile, as does a crowbar [2 gp],
a grappling hook [1 gp], and a miner’s pick [3 gp].
Strewn throughout the pile are six pitons [1 sp
each] and a full bag of caltrops [1 gp]. Small piles
of coins exist in several places throughout the
nest [61 gp, 183 sp, 127 cp total]. Buried in the
back corner are several bones, which look to be
from a gnome. One skeletal hand still wears a
pair of rings [signet ring, 5 gp; silver and topaz ring,
500 gp]. Another bony hand clutches a composite
shortbow [75 gp, missing bowstring] built for a
small creature. A quiver, mostly chewed
through, still holds four shortbow arrows [5 cp
each]. A signal whistle [8 sp] is clipped to the
quiver. [Total 1,000.19 gp]
11 You see a large wooden crate [2 gp], still fastened
shut. Upon opening it, you find a large bundle
wrapped in beige linen [5 square yards, 20 gp].
When unrolled, it proves to be a rug made of the
soft black and brown spotted skin of some exotic
animal. The rug is backed with thick black
felt and is large enough for a tall man to stretch
out on it [176 gp]. Left in the crate are a few
small pouches and bundles. One leather pouch
[1 gp] holds a necklace of seashells strung on a
silken cord [7 gp]. Most shells are curled, about
the size of a thumbnail; but some smaller, flatter
ones are interspersed with the others. It is fastened
just with a simple knot, but is long enough
to go on and off over a person’s head. Another
pouch [1 gp] has a two-strand necklace made of
smooth leather cord wrapped around heavier
strands of leather [5 sp]. From the longer strand
dangle three smooth, flat stones of brown and
tan, roughly oval in shape but not finely cut or
polished. Three smaller stones hang from the
shorter strand. In the same pouch is a woman’s
bracelet made of three braided strands of rough
turquoise beads strung on silver wire [143 gp]. At
the bottom of the crate, a folded piece of leather
[3 sp] covers a sturdy cotton sack [1 gp] with four
metal bars inside. Each weighs a pound, but one
is made of platinum [500 gp] and three are made
of gold [50 gp each]. [Total 1,001.8 gp]
12 A set of saddlebags with two pouches on each
side [4 gp], an excellent riding saddle appointed
with steel rivets [40 gp] and a bit and bridle [2 gp]
rest on a broken and rickety bench, which looks
barely able to support the weight. A wineskin
filled with a very good wine [6 gp] is tied to the
front of the saddle. The saddle sits on a pair of
thin saddle blankets made from expertly woven
linen thread [1 gp each]. The front pouch on the
left side holds loose coins, all of which look like
they have been recently washed and polished.
The coins are predominantly silver with some
gold and a few platinum pieces mixed in [10 pp,
49 gp, 124 sp]. The other left pouch holds four
small crystalline vials with gold stoppers. Each
one is filled with a thin liquid having no discernable
smell [vials with arsenic, 128 gp each].

On the right side, the front pouch carries three
days of trail rations [5 sp each]. The final pouch
contains a small leather pouch [1 gp] tied with a
piece of twine and two small vials of antitoxin
[50 gp each]. Untying the pouch reveals a small
collection of tiny gemstones. There are nine
stones altogether: three smooth, polished blue
stones [lapis lazuli; 10 gp each], one deep, rich
green piece [peridot; 50 gp], two are a bright yellow
with bands of dark green running the length
of them [jasper; 50 gp each], and three are dark
black with light spots of gray on one side [common
stones; 1 cp each ]. [Total 1,009.93 gp]
13 A sideboard sits against the wall, its front and
sides bearing the skin of some exotic animal.
The top, frame, and legs are of carved and polished
wood, but the sides and the fronts of the
two drawers are covered with very short, tawny
and black striped fur [186 gp]. In the top drawer
lie three hand mirrors, colorful and elegant [145
gp each]. The backs of the mirrors are enameled
with bright tropical flowers, while the handles
are three-dimensional exotic birds. The birds are
also in a rainbow of colors, and bits of crystal
sparkle along their heads and long tails. In the
lower drawer you find a trio of copper candleholders
from one to two hand-spans tall. Their
wide cups and bases are decorated with leaf
designs, and separated by pedestals formed of
open, intertwined spirals [set 45 gp]. Beside these
lies a sturdy leather pouch [1 gp] that feels as if it
is filled with coins. When you open it, you discover
it also holds a necklace made of chips of
rose quartz with silver beads interspersed among
them. From the necklace dangles an oval pendant
made from mother of pearl [308 gp]. There
are also coins, mostly copper and silver [17 gp,
140 sp, 218 cp]. [Total 1,008.18 gp]
14 Pulling open a dark wood armoire made splendid
by gold fittings [90 gp], you see row after row
of fine clothing, all hanging neatly on identical
bamboo hangers. There are three seductively cut
silk dresses [50 gp each], identical save for their
color [blood red, snow white and jet black]; all
three are deceptively simple, but all are products
of a master tailor. A pale brown mink cloak with
a blue silk lining [110 gp] hangs beside the dresses
along with a thin silver necklace with a long
blue crystal pendant [blue quartz, 29 gp]. Four
pairs of men’s breeches in various shades of blue
and grey, all with similar square bronze buttons
[5 gp each], are in the far corner of the wardrobe.
A kid leather cloak [78 gp], tooled with geometric
patterns and lined with white silk, hangs
alongside the pants. A hidden pouch in the
cloak holds a woman’s belt shaped as a delicate
golden chain of roses [231 gp]. A linen moneybag
stuffed into the shadows of the wardrobe
holds an amazing number of coins; silver pieces
fill the bag nearly to bursting [1,301 sp]. Among
the coins is a silver ring [50 gp] designed as a
series of twisted bands, which fit together like
puzzle pieces, but fall apart if the ring is
removed. A necklace of wide silver circles, each
with a piece of orange agate at its center [112
gp], winds its way through the coins. [Total
1,000.1 gp]
15 A large ceramic jar sits against the wall. It is
taller than a man’s arm is long, and a forearm’s
length across at it widest point. Intricate, colorful
designs run the length and breadth of the jar,
and it seems to be an item of some worth [500
gp]. When you examine it, you see the lid is
tightly sealed. You pull at the lid, but to no avail;
there is no budging it. It looks as if the only way
to find out what is inside the jar is to break it
open. However, moving the jar around tells you
it is very heavy [500 pounds], and you hear what
sounds like coins shifting inside it. [The lid is
thoroughly sealed. The only mundane methods of
getting at the contents involve damaging the container
in some way. The adventurers can smash the jar
to reveal the contents, or try to carefully break off
the top. Successfully breaking off the top will lower
the value of the item to 80 gp due to the rough opening
left. If the adventurers get the jar open:]
Opening the jar you discover it is full of coins of
all types [308 gp, 4,195 sp, 20,434 cp]. [Note: It
should be practically impossible for a party to retain
the 500 gp value of the jar and also get the money
that waits within. The party can sell the vase intact
for 500 gp, or break it open as described and get the
money plus possibly salvage the remainder of the
container for 80 gp]. [Total 1,011.84 gp]
16 You find a longsword, books, a lamp and a rough
wooden box. The longsword [225 gp] is handsome,
set with two large greenish stones [green
garnets]. The sheath is fine calfskin, with a second
sheath attached to it about halfway up [10
gp]. In the smaller sheath is a long dirk [210 gp],
in the same style as the longsword with two
matching garnets in the hilt. There are three
books stacked together. The first is thick, bound
in blue leather and well enough made. Despite
heavy use, it is still in excellent condition. It
contains a collection of herbal healing recipes as
well as notes and comments from previous owners
[37 gp]. The second book is a slim volume
bound in red with gold lettering; it is the journal
of a diplomat who traveled in little-known
regions. [The regions are still of little interest and
the diplomat was pompous; 8 gp.] The third book
has a black leather binding but the pages are
empty [a spellbook, 15 gp]. The lamp is copper,
table V: 1,000 gold pieces
65
with gray metal [tin] decorations [5 sp]. It is full
of oil and a spare flask sits next to it [1 sp]. In the
small rough wooden box [5 sp] you find a gold
openwork cover on a chain, which closes over a
plate [censer for burning incense; 25 gp], 16 fine
white wax candles [2 sp each], and a white linen
handkerchief [4 sp]. Below these lie a gold
bracelet [42 gp] and necklace [60 gp] of delicate
chains with square links, a silver ring with a
small clear, bluish stone [aquamarine; 308 gp],
and under these a pile of thousands of copper
pieces, with a few gold and silver thrown in [20
gp, 66 sp, 4,006 cp]. [Total 1,011.36 gp]
17 A black leather sack, in very good condition [16
gp], sits folded over its dark crimson, tasseled
drawstrings knotted but not difficult to open.
The sack is as long as a woman’s arm, and half as
wide across. The leather of the sack is tooled
with an ornate pattern of stylized, winding
flames and swirling clouds. In the center of the
design on the front of the sack a burning sun
with many winding arms of flame frames the initials
“TS”, in the common tongue of the land.
Within the sack you find a good steel lock, of
medium weight [Good lock; 80 gp], also inscribed
with the initials “TS” in common. The lock is
the size of a man’s fist, and tied to it with dark
red cord is a heavy skeleton key, wrought of iron
[5 gp]. In addition to the lock you find a well
cared for set of thieves’ tools [50 gp], kept in a
soft case of crimson leather. A few scraps of
paper, wrapped about some of the tools, fall to
dust as you touch them. You find more items in
the leather sack: a small quartz crystal falcon
statuette with a snake grasped in its talons [75
gp], a small, perfectly formed black pearl with a
greenish hue [500 gp], and a pair of decorative
bronze cuffs [270 gp] coated with a ghostly tinge
of verdigris. A pattern of flame and cloud similar
to that on the leather sack is inscribed on the
cuffs. They are decorated with jet inlay and sized
for a small woman’s wrists. [Total 996 gp]
18 You have found your way into a room which
looks like it has been used to store pieces of art.
Many of the pieces—paintings, sculptures and
the like—have been destroyed or defaced in
some way and are probably not worth trying to
sell, but some items are intact. A painting of
wild horses running through a green meadow
sits in the corner. It is mounted in a beautiful
gilded frame and should be worth something to
the right person [135 gp]. Near the painting you
notice a lap harp, about two feet tall, carved
from a very dark wood. The strings are still
intact and it is obviously a high-quality instrument
[masterwork, 100 gp]. You continue to look
through the pieces of artwork and find a statuette
of a beholder fashioned from silver. It is
finely crafted and quite eerie to behold [110 gp].
Finally you discover a miniature carving of a
building lying under a badly moth-eaten rug.
The building looks as if it may be a temple of
some kind and it is carved from a single piece of
red garnet. You lift the exquisite, tiny building
and marvel at the detail the sculptor put into
the piece [665 gp]. [Total 1,010 gp]
19 Here you see a pile of backpacks, three smaller
bags, and a large stack of weapons and armor.
There are half a dozen longswords [15 gp each], a
greatsword [50 gp], seven coats of scalemail [50
gp each], two large steel shields [20 gp each] and
four small steel shields [9 gp each]. Examining
the backpacks [7 backpacks; 2 gp each] you find
each contains substantially the same things: a
flask of oil [7 flasks, 1 sp each], three days of trail
rations [21 days rations, 15 sp each], a bedroll [7
bedrolls; 1 sp each] and a spare traveler’s outfit [5
outfits, 1 gp each; 2 outfits, 3 gp each]. Each traveler’s
outfit consists of a pair of trousers and a
shirt with laces. One shirt is black, two are blue,
one is purple, one red and two brown. Five pairs
of trousers are brown and two are black. The
black trousers and the black and purple shirts are
laced with silver thread.
Opening the three smaller bags [1 sp each],
you find one contains gold coins [323 gp] and a
copper bracelet [25 gp], about as wide as a man’s
thumb, open on one side to make it easier to
the mother of all treasure tables
66
wear. The face of the bracelet has been covered
with patterned snakeskin leather. The second
holds silver [339 sp] and also a stiff black leather
belt [15 gp], a handspan wide, set with shiny
pieces of silver in irregular geometric shapes.
Each metal piece is no larger than a fingernail,
but thick lines of them loop up and down the
length of the belt, which fastens with a square
silver buckle. The final bag has copper pieces
[520 cp] and also holds three brass mugs [2 gp
each]. [Total 1,032.3 gp]
20 You see a bundle of spears, with several small
sacks and pouches of different sizes piled on top.
[If the spears are examined first:] You find there
are six spears altogether, bound up with a length
of silk rope. Five are identical, with plain ashwood
shafts and diamond-shaped steel points as
long as a man’s hand [2 gp each]. The sixth is
slightly longer than the others, with a shaft of
oak inlaid with cherry; the inlays spiral up and
around the shaft in long curlicues [masterwork,
402 gp]. The spear’s tip is steel, with jagged
reverse barbs along its length, and one side is
etched with a scene depicting a battle between
gnolls and dwarves on a craggy mountaintop.
The spears are resting atop a battle-scarred
heavy steel shield [masterwork, 190 gp]. The face
of the shield has a ring of dwarven runes running
around its edge, each made of darker steel [they
read, “may the blows of a thousand giants be turned
by this shield”], and a finger-length spike set into
its center. Of the bags, there are three sacks and
two pouches. The sacks are simple canvas bags
[1 sp each], each filled with mixed coinage [10
gp, 25 sp, 50 cp; 30 gp, 45 sp, 24 cp; 28 gp, 20 sp,
26 cp], while the two small pouches are made of
green-dyed leather and each branded with a picture
of three dead orcs’ heads [2 gp each]. One
holds a handful of freshwater pearls [13 pearls;
10 gp each]; the other, assorted chunks of banded
and moss agate [19 pieces; 10 gp each]. [Total
1,004.3 gp]
21 You discover quite a store of food here; cheese,
meat, potatoes and other vegetables, and other
foodstuffs fill several sacks and boxes [food and
containers, 50 gp total]. You find a wooden box [3
sp] holding a complete set of silverware [enough
for six place settings]. The silver eating utensils
look as they probably did the day they were new,
and they are exquisitely forged [set, 60 gp].
Sitting in a cabinet [or: another box; 3 sp] you
find six clear crystal wine glasses, each one perfectly
crafted and also in pristine condition [120
gp]. Further investigation reveals a silver serving
tray large enough to carry six full dining plates
with ease. The edge has a very intricate design
which forms many types of flowers, with a giant
rose etched into the center [180 gp]. Finally you
discover a wooden box holding two dozen bottles
of wine. You read the labels and see each
bottle is at least a hundred years old [25 gp each].
[Total 1,010.6 gp]
22 In one corner of the room stands a dressing table
and chair. Both items of furniture are made from
a decorative hard wood and inscribed with patterns
of flowers and leaves [set, 300 gp]. Judging
from their size, they would be suitable for a
human or elven woman or girl. Fastened to the
top of the table is a tall mirror, so anyone sitting
in the chair would be able to see her own face.
The mirror is made of a good quality of glass and
is backed by the same hard wood [150 gp]. All of
the furniture seems recently polished and in
excellent condition. The tabletop contains a
range of what must be cosmetics and beauty
aids. Three tortoise-shell combs sparkle with
crystals and rest in one corner of the table [40 gp
each] next to four tiny circular ceramic pots
which are tightly closed. These contain rouge in
different shades of pink [set, 40 gp]. Three thin
horsehair brushes [set, 10 gp] rest on a palate of
six shades of eye coloring, which range from a
very pale bronze to a rich dark purple [set, 60 gp].
[These colors actually contain expensive ingredients
including powdered gold, cochineal and rare moth
wings.] Nine slightly larger pots, each about the
size of a lady’s fist, contain face creams, antiwrinkle
creams, preparations of rock mud and
salt, cucumber slices preserved in aspic, a wooden
backscratcher, powders for darkening the
eyes and lotions for lightening the skin [25 gp
each]. There is also a heavy hairbrush made from
silver with very fine animal bristles, and a
matching silver comb. These pieces are marked
with a crown and pennant symbol which is not
immediately recognizable [set, 95 gp]. [All of this
boudoir equipment was stolen during the kidnapping
of a princess from a distant country. Although there
is no sign of the princess, her family members and
subjects would be delighted to find any evidence of
her fate.] [Total 1,000 gp]
23 A large green-oak water barrel [30 gp] has been
banded with glittering strips of gold, and has
been filled with an assortment of treasures, great
and small. Thousands of copper coins [4,300 cp]
are used as ‘packing material’, holding the treasures
tight within the container. Two longspears
jut from the barrel, their iron points inlaid with
gold skulls [57 gp each]. A delicate glass drinking
cup, decorated with pink glass spirals [15 gp] is
filled with chips of beautiful bright-blue stones
[blue rock, 100 pieces, 5 sp] and one small deep
blue stone [blue spinel, 90 gp]. An elaborate
horned helm with fertility runes carved across
table V: 1,000 gold pieces
67
its face [40 gp] has been upended to contain
hundreds of silver coins [530 sp], each stamped
with a spear and shield. Two wax-stoppered clay
jugs [2 cp each] hold two gallons of stinking lamp
oil apiece [2 gp each]. A bronze cuirass [breastplate;
125 gp] engraved with loops and circles,
rests against the side of the barrel, near a set of
leather bracers, studded with gold flowers [82
gp]. A brown silk scarf with complementary patterns
[25 gp], lies on top of a black-handled iron
axe [62 gp], which has a pair of ivory crosses
inlaid into the haft on either side. A pair of
brown leather trousers, braided with red and
gold thread [15 gp] is wadded up towards the
center of the barrel. One pocket holds mixed
coins [8 gp, 97 sp, 18 cp], and a silver hairpin
with a narrow coral handle [55 gp]. Near the
pants, you find a golden flute [111 gp], with a
miniature pennant dangling from the end. A
cherrywood lute [masterwork, 120 gp] with tightly
stretched catgut strings lies beyond the flute.
The lute’s body is carved with striped patterns
which might represent grass or the fur of an animal.
[Total 1,002.42 gp]
24 The walls, the ceiling, and all the contents are
hung with thick dusty webs. In the far corner
rests a dark wooden chest [2 gp], its smooth lid
covered with the same webbing, which coats the
rest of the room. You examine the chest and find
the lock is broken. As you lift the lid to discover
what treasure lies within, the dust you have
disturbed floats up in a cloud above the chest.
Inside you first notice a silk pillow [2 gp] covering
whatever else may be in the chest. You lift
the pillow and your eyes fall upon a stunning silver
helmet, which is lying sideways, partially
buried in a pile of coins. Lifting the helm, you
are immediately struck by its excellent design. It
appears to be made from one piece of silver and
it has fine lines carved in it making circular
shapes atop the helmet [silver masterwork helmet,
weight 4 pounds; 190 gp]. Setting the helmet
down carefully, you begin to rifle through the
coins in the chest [1 pp, 408 gp, 2,632 sp, 5,463
cp]. At the very bottom of the chest you find a
lightweight wooden box [1 gp]. Inside, well
cushioned by woolen scraps, rests a rainbowhued
polished glass bowl. It could have been
part of a showpiece collection. It shows no sign
of wear, but you can tell it is quite delicate [68
gp]. [Total 998.83]
25 A greataxe and a greatsword lie awkwardly
across the long dimension of a large wooden box
[1 gp]. The greataxe has beautiful stark lines
without embellishment [20 gp]. The sword is its
opposite, excessively decorated: the hilt is covered
with dozens of tiny figures in warlike activities
and many small gems while the blade is
inscribed with warlike phrases everywhere but
on the cutting edge [6 azurite, 6 hematite, 6 lapis
lazuli; greatsword, 230 gp]. Lying partly under the
axe is a longbow of yew [75 gp] and a leather
quiver painted with game animals [2 gp] holding
nine arrows [5 cp each]. Beneath them are a pair
of very dressy black leather shoes for a middlesized
person [4 gp], a fluffy green wool scarf and
matching mittens [8 sp], and a small box [70 gp].
The box is silver with raised designs in gold wire,
circling four small green gems [malachite]. Inside,
the box is divided into four sections. In one lie
five small but perfect silver pearls [90 gp each], in
another is a rough powder [diamond dust, 100 gp],
the third holds a bit of clean sand [1 cp] and the
fourth is empty. The final item in the box is a tall
blue glass cylinder [5 gp] which holds a variety of
coins: gold pieces from across the known
world—some quite old—silvers, some of them so
worn you can tell nothing of who minted them,
and coppers large and small [44 gold, 52 silver,
311 copper]. [Total 1,010.57 gp]
26 Two identical statues of a wolf stand on either
side of a wooden chest. The statues are not fullsized,
standing only about the height of a man’s
calf. The wolf is shown howling, as if at the
moon. As you approach the statues and the
chest you can see more detail on the sculptures.
They look as if they are carved out of marble
[133 gp each]. When you examine the chest [2
gp], you are a bit surprised to find it is unlocked.
You open the lid and the first thing you see is a
fur coat. It feels like mink, and as you lift it you
can see it is a full-length coat in immaculate
condition [350 gp]. The mink coat took up most
of the space inside the chest. There is a wooden
box [1 foot wide, 6 inches deep and 6 inches high]
with a hinged lid lying on a bunch of loose coins
at the bottom of the chest [198 gp; 1,290 sp].
You find the box holds all kinds of makeup, fake
hair, and other items leading you to realize this
is a disguise kit [50 gp]. [Total 995 gp]
27 A box contains a great shield—oval and taller
than a halfling—of reinforced oak [10 gp], a
longsword [15 gp] in an undecorated gray leather
sheath, a sleek, sharp, unremarkable throwing
knife [3 gp], twenty bags of small black iron caltrops
[1 gp each] and a large magnifying glass
with a burnished brass handle and fittings [110
gp]. Jumbled under them are slim books with
gold lettering on their red leather bindings.
[These are condensed encyclopedic information on
the geography, properties and medical and magical
uses of: rocks, gems, alchemicals (2 volumes), powders
and dyes. 6 books, 50 gp each] Next to the
books are a pair of brown leather work boots,
the mother of all treasure tables
68
not quite new, for large feet [5 gp] and a tall
metal cup with a tight-fitting lid [pewter, 3 gp].
In one of the boots you find an irregular nugget
of raw silver the size of your fist [3 pounds, 15 gp],
three small pieces of light yellow amber [50 gp
each], a spool of heavy black thread with a largeeyed
needle stuck through the center of the
spool [6 sp] and various coins [30 pp, 65 gp, 32
sp, 64 cp]. [Total 1,000.44 gp]
28 You see a round drum, more than knee high,
painted yellow with a white leather head and
matching drumsticks [6 gp]. Beside it lies a heavy
battle axe with runes burned into the oak haft
[15 gp; runes read ‘victory’ or something similar], a
pair of formal black boots [20 gp] and a torn
backpack in need of repair [5 cp]. In the backpack,
you find a dark iron dagger [13 gp] with a
piece of hematite in the hilt, two linen tunics for
a small man or large woman [4 sp each] and a
black leather belt pouch [2 gp]. The belt pouch
reveals four gold pieces and fourteen silvers, but
it has a false back; at the back are files, picks, and
forceps from medium sized to very delicate
[thieves’ tools, 30 gp]. Stuffed at the bottom of the
backpack are a long plaid skirt [1 sp], a quilted
vest [2 sp], a frilly white blouse [3 sp], a net shawl
[4 sp] and three bandanas [2 cp each]. Tied in the
corners of one faded red bandana are two rings.
The first one is gold, shaped like a flower around
a single fine tourmaline [140 gp]. The second
ring is platinum with a black pearl [550 gp]. The
boots would be knee-high on a tall man [20 gp].
[If the adventurers move the boots, it is obvious one
is much heavier than the other. Otherwise, they must
investigate the toe of one boot to discover:] In the
toe of one is a sack with a few coins [8 gp, 14 sp]
and a silver bracelet with nine large pieces of
malachite [200 gp]. [Total 992.71 gp]
29 The first thing you see is a war drum, knee high
and twice that across, with a heavy leather head
painted with images of fires and arrows. Its
drumsticks hang from the edge and there are
heavy leather straps for lifting it, although it
would require a very big person [50 gp]. A composite
longbow [100 gp] lies next to it, along
with a tooled black leather quiver [2 gp] with
twenty arrows [1 gp], all black wood fletched
with gray goose feathers. Under those are four
bolts [15 yards each] of cloth: pink linen [60 gp],
flowered green velvet [90 gp], purple silk [150 gp]
and gray wool [15 gp]. You also find a small black
iron cooking pot with a lid [6 sp], a delicate,
blue-flowered porcelain teapot [30 gp] and a
small silver box. The box has elegant twining
leaf patterns and is just larger than fits comfortably
in one hand [30 gp]. The top lifts off to
show a set of fine cosmetics: sweet smelling blue,
red, beige and green powders, a pair of silver
tweezers and a fine soft brush with an ivory handle
[camel hair brush; cosmetics set 100 gp]. A
small tubular case of metal [2 gp] holds a rolled
map [details of a local landmark or GM’s choice; 5
gp]. A leather sack [1 sp] holds a heavy gold
chain [170 gp], two small gold holy symbols [to a
sea god, 30 gp each], coins [30 gp, 79 sp, 99 cp]
and some small gems [5 obsidian, 6 tigereye; 10 gp
ea]. [Total 1,014.59 gp]
30 You find a leather backpack [2 gp]. As you lift it,
its weight tells you it is full. You open it and discover
many items which seem just thrown in
together. The first thing you lift out is a silver
necklace with a beautiful aquamarine set in the
center of it [545 gp]. Next you find a dagger with
nicks all along the blade, which is probably not
worth much [1 gp]. Looking again into the pack,
you retrieve an impressive folding knife [75 gp].
The handle is made of pale wood with gold trim
running around its perimeter. The knife opens
easily out of the handle to reveal a perfect silver
blade [the same length as a dagger blade]. The
workmanship is really excellent. You reach into
the pack again and pull out an odd piece of
jagged rock about the size of a walnut. Goldenyellow
bits peek out among chunks of grey and
brownish stone [raw topaz, 176 gp as is]. In the
bottom of the pack you can hear the jingle of
coins, and you pull out a handful of platinum
pieces [21 pp]. [Total 1,009 gp]
31 You see a shapely chair with arms. It is made of
cherry wood, the joints carefully constructed,
the details all painstakingly finished [15 gp]. In
the chair sits a plain, dark wood lute [it has a nice
tone but is missing one string; 5 gp]. A piece of fur
draped over the back of the chair is in fact a
short cape made of mink [stole, 200 gp]. Three
pairs of long thin slats of wood lie behind the
chair. They are well polished and have leather
straps fastened to the top near the middle. Next
to them lie six slender wooden poles with
tapered tips [skis with poles, 5 gp each set]. There
is also a long, thin scimitar, the hilt in the shape
of longship, with details picked out in gold [not
masterwork, 28 gp]. The scimitar is in a sleek
dark leather sheath, which was clearly made for
it. Under the chair is stuffed a woolen blanket of
light and dark gray plaid [5 sp], a ball of white
yarn [about the size of a baseball, 2 cp], a pair of
heavy brown leather gauntlets [2 gp] and a small
copper box about two hand spans long and one
wide [2 gp]. The box is locked [DC 15 to open
without damaging the box]. In the box you find,
wrapped in ragged strips of linen, a pair of graceful
gold goblets [175 gp each] each decorated
with a large piece of jet, a silver ring [320 gp]
table V: 1,000 gold pieces
69
with three brownish stones [garnets] as the flowers
in a bouquet carved in the silver, and various
coins filling the bottom [17 gp, 224 sp, 711 cp].
[Total 984.03 gp]
32 You find four small oaken casks, each of which
has a tarnished spigot attached to it [30 gallon
casks of gnomish fire whiskey; 150 gp each]. Each
cask is branded with an emblem depicting a
drunken gnome riding a wild boar. There is a
canvas sack sitting atop one of the casks, from
which emanates a faint odor of decay; atop
another cask is a black leather case. Opening
the sack, you find it is full of desiccated fingers,
each of which is wearing a signet ring [13 human
fingers, a mix of male and female; signet rings 5 gp
each]. The rings are identical, each bearing the
device of a round shield on which are three
ravens in flight. The black leather case contains
a set of exceptionally fine thieves’ tools [masterwork,
100 gp], all of which are covered in dried
blood. Stuck to the inside of the case (and also
caked with blood) is a belt pouch [3 gp]. A small
piece of horn in the shape of a boar’s head holds
the pouch shut. It contains a few platinum
pieces [6 pp], six small chunks of blue quartz [10
gp each] and three rings. Two of the rings are
made of copper, bright green from oxidization,
and set with tiny chips of obsidian in the shape
of a falling star [12 gp each]. The third ring is
made of red wood with silver wire inlays, and set
with a lustrous moonstone shaped like a drop of
water [88 gp]. [Total 1,000 gp]
33 You spot a wardrobe made of burnished wood
standing in a corner [100 gp]. It has two doors
with polished ivory handles and a small cabinet
at the top with sliding doors. The main compartment
of the wardrobe holds a collection of
courtier clothing of the finest silks, linens, and
soft wools [7 courtier’s outfits, 30 gp each]. All are
sized for a short, slim human woman or a tallerthan-
average half-elf. There is also a thick winter
cloak with mink fur trim and a muff [95 gp
set], and five pairs of leggings [10 sp each]. At the
bottom of the wardrobe are three pairs of shoes
[10 gp each] and a pair of apparently unworn
high leather boots with gleaming brass rivets [25
gp pair]. The sliding doors on the top cabinet
open to expose a large empty space holding a
long, thin wooden box about the length and
width of a human forearm, but twice as high [5
sp]. This box has a sliding top, which reveals a
number of cylindrical tubes of oiled paper several
inches long and about as big around as a typical
coin. Several of the tubes are marked in red
ink by a circle with a spot in the middle. Inside
each tube is a stack of coins. Those marked with
the symbol are gold; the others are silver. There
are four tubes of gold coins and eight tubes of silver
[50 coins per tube; 199 gp, 400 sp, the owner
miscounted one of the gold stacks]. Lying loose in
the box are another eight gold and 12 silver
coins [8 gp, 12 sp]. There is also a small square
box of cherry wood [4 sp], smooth to the touch
with inlaid designs of dark cocobolo and zebrawood
on its cover. Opening the small brass
latch, you find two rings with small gems. One is
a slender gold ring set with a carnelian gem [75
gp], the second is a somewhat more substantial
silver vermeil ring set with a beautiful maroon
garnet and two small citrine gems [225 gp]. [Total
1,014.1 gp]
34 A striking (and very heavy) mirror leans against
the wall. It is nearly an arms-length wide and a
forearms-length high, with a rectangular frame
of wrought iron, embellished with swirls at the
corners and along the top, holding a sheet of
smooth silver [647 gp]. From the lower edge of
the frame, three holders bend down and out,
ending in sturdy circular bases for candles. Next
to this sits a calf-high decorated pot, made of
highly glazed white porcelain painted with blue
designs of water lilies and lake birds [62 gp]. In
the top of the pot, wrapped carefully in gray
wool, is a blue glass pitcher with a wide, stable
bottom tapering to an elegantly shaped lip and
handle [7 gp]. Under this is a gray leather bag [1
gp], which holds a gold frame for a small painting.
The opening in the center of the frame is
about the size of a man’s palm. The frame itself
is at least as thick on all sides as the same man’s
three fingers and is elaborately carved with
swirls and shell shapes [87 gp]. Also in the bag,
folded into a piece of linen [1 gp] is a silver pin
in the shape of a flower. Its petals are enameled
in pink and its center is a cluster of small pieces
of rose quartz [208 gp]. [Total 1,013 gp]
35 In a large chest [3 gp] you find two great dwarven
waraxes, the blades particularly well made,
decorated with flattened gold wire [35 gp each], a
long gray wool cloak [3 gp], a pair of sandals for
very big feet [2 sp], a large cloth sack, a smaller
leather bag and two boxes. The sack [2 sp] is
loosely tied with a strip of leather. Inside it you
find six iron grappling hooks [1 gp each], a dozen
black iron pitons [1 sp each], two coils of fine silk
rope [50 feet each; 10 gp each], a pointed red wool
cap [2 sp] and a knitted scarf with blue and pink
stripes [2 sp]. The leather bag [1 sp] bulges with
well made sling bullets, all the same size and
weight and all nearly perfectly spherical [50 bullets;
2 cp each]. The larger of the two boxes is
about the size to hold shoes. It is plain wood and
the top lifts off [5 sp]. Inside it are packed a long
black linen tunic [5 sp], a pair of brown socks [4
the mother of all treasure tables
70
cp], a jade holy symbol [to a local deity; 150 gp] on
a gold chain [15 gp], a silver chain [4 gp] with a
large bluish gem [aquamarine] set in silver as a
pendant [515 gp], a leather belt [4 sp] and two
pouches. One pouch [1 sp] holds coins [15 gp, 22
sp, 80 cp]; the other [1 sp] contains semiprecious
stones [7 hematite, 5 agate, 6 azurite and 3
turquoise; 10 gp each]. The second box is small,
made of light-colored wood brightly painted
with animals [box 2 sp]. The top lifts off easily to
show it is empty. [Total 1,018.94 gp]
36 Here you find a variety of items. You see a longbow
[composite longbow, +2 Strength, 300 gp]
with a green leather grip and black leather
quiver which has a design of thorny vines cut
out in a masterful work of art; the design is cut
in the black leather to reveal a green leather
underneath. The quivery contains a dozen masterwork
arrows sporting black shafts with green
fletching [73 gp]. Closer inspection reveals the
bow is a mighty composite bow. It is accompanied
by a silver and leather archers arm-guard.
The silver piece is inset into the leather, and is
engraved with flowers and thorny vines [12 gp].
There are two very well made longswords [12 gp
each] and one short sword [7 gp]. The swords
have leather scabbards matching the color of
the leather used to make the grip of the hilt;
black, brown, and green [respectively]. There is a
masterwork ash spear, perfectly balanced for
throwing and with a keen blade. The spear bears
the name “Far-biter” [302 gp]. Four daggers [2 gp
each] have fallen down among some bags with
shoulder straps. The three shoulder bags [2 sp
each] are of a heavy canvas that appears to be
quite durable. The contents of all the shoulder
bags include three bedrolls of a very fine and
unusually lightweight construction [5 sp each].
There is also an iron pot [5 sp] and a total of 3
wooden bowls and spoons [42 cp] finely carved
with leaf designs on the spoon handles and rims
of the bowls. There are also three smaller bags
tied with cord worked into the bag in such a way
that it can be drawn shut. The smaller bags are
made from fine twill weave designs of red and
black; green and black; and grey and green [3 sp
each] and contain a mixture of coins. [30 pp, 59
gp, 29 sp, 26 cp] [Total 1,092.08 gp]
37 In a large canvas sack [3 sp] is a longsword [decorated,
not masterwork; 315 gp] with runes on the
blade and a faceted red stone [large garnet] as big
as a man’s thumbnail in the pommel. [The runes
are in an uncommon language, and boast of its
power.] The sword rests in a sheath designed to
carry it on the wielder’s back, the leather stained
green with complex lighter green geometric
designs [4 gp]. A metal bowl, unadorned, the size
of a standard eating bowl [of pewter or tin, 5 sp]
and a long wooden ladle [4 sp] lie next to a cleverly
designed folding wooden chair [ash, folds to
one quarter size; 2 gp]. A drawstring sack [4 sp]
holds a smaller-than-usual repeating light crossbow
[perhaps for halflings or gnomes] and has a
pouch [2 sp] with two sets of five bolts [crossbow
250 gp, bolts 1 gp per set]. A round metal box [tin,
8 sp] opens to reveal a bright copper holy symbol
set with four turquoise pieces [symbol of the sun
god, 30 gp], a small pale-green jade monkey [or
demon; 265 gp], and a plain silver brooch set
with three green stones [malachite; brooch, 70
gp]. A rough unglazed clay jar [2 cp] holds a couple
handfuls of coins [33 gp, 80 sp and 59 cp].
[Total 982.21 gp]
38 In a tattered hempen sack [2 sp] the length and
easily the width of a large man, you discover a
greatsword coated with alchemical silver [240
gp]. Along the length of the blade are beautifully
rendered depictions of the moon in all of her
phases, from a smiling sliver to a fully realized
lunar sphere. The hilt is wrapped with a bright
red silk cord, ending in a thick tassel. In the sack
you also find a large dark blue silk pouch [5 gp].
Inside the pouch you find several hundred coins
[3 pp, 100 gp, 350 sp]. Weighting the sack is a
chain shirt adorned with a pale blue quartz on its
breast [175 gp], and atop this rattle three small
bottles of viscous green liquid [anti-toxin, 50 gp
each]. Beneath the sack is a shield of dark wood
[darkwood shield, 257 gp] which can be lifted with
great ease, as if it weighed nearly the same as a
handful of feathers. Carved upon its surface is
the regal visage of a great hound. [Total 986.2 gp]
39 Here you find a wooden flute [5 gp] beside a belt
pouch containing bone dice [3 sp], six gold
pieces, flint and steel for starting fires [1 gp], a
long copper hatpin [3 cp], and a tiny well executed
dark-green stone statue of a deity [patron
of earth, the stone is a dark jade; 350 gp]. There are
a plain iron bit and bridle for a horse, well used
but in good condition [2 gp], a fine light-brown
military saddle [20 gp] and a horse blanket [2 gp].
A long leather belt, with elaborate tooling on it
and a simple silver buckle [belt 5 sp, buckle 2 gp]
is rolled in a neat coil. Three cloth sacks [1 sp
each] contain dry beans [5 pounds, 2 sp], peas
[about 15 pounds, 1 gp] and wheat [10 pounds, 1
sp]. [If these sacks have been there any length of
time, the contents will be mostly dust and insect bodies.]
Under the sacks lie a spear and two axes.
The spear is ash, as tall as a man and nicely balanced,
with a fine iron head [3 gp]. The two axes
are nearly identical battle axes, dwarf sized, with
ironwood hafts and black steel blades [12 gp
each]. A small black wood box [2 gp] is sealed
table V: 1,000 gold pieces
71
shut with wax, but it rattles. [If the box is opened:]
Inside you find an amethyst [100 gp], two bloodstones
[50 gp each], a sardonyx [50 gp], a red
spinel [100 gp] and 11 pieces of blue quartz [10
gp each]. A leather pouch near the box is filled
with coins [102 gp, 211 sp, 350 cp]. [Total
1,006.03 gp]
40 Resting on the floor against the wall is a leather
traveling case about the size of a backpack [2 gp].
Untying the cords to look inside, you find a variety
of travel documents, now presumably out of
date, together with some very fine ladies’ undergarments
in red and purple silk [60 gp], a tiny
brush with a hand-length ivory handle [for
cleaning teeth; 35 gp] and a palm-sized powder pot
made from ivory and carved with tiny pictures of
angels [215 gp]. A flat, elegant wooden cosmetics
box contains ivory pots holding several different
kinds of superior-quality face paint, rouge,
skin whitener, eye darkener, lip color and suitably
sized brushes to apply all of them, also made
from ivory [set, 300 gp]. There is a slender
leather-bound book [2 gp] which contains lists of
names with numbers in what seems to be some
sort of code, and notations of amounts of money.
[A hidden compartment inside the case holds a small
purse containing 28 gold pieces.] The leather of
the case is calf-skin and consists of several soft
pieces sewn together. Cunningly hidden
between two such pieces is a well executed and
autographed canvas painting [350 gp], [of the
River Nune delta or some other famous location] by
a semi-famous court painter [Stravrolous the Vivid
or any other suitable artist]. [Total: 995 gp]
41 Leaning against the wall is a tall folding screen
made from five panels of dark wood, carved and
painted [189 gp]. It is as tall as a tall man, and an
arm-span wide in total. The top section of each
panel is painted with a delicate bouquet of roses,
each in a different color. The lower sections are
painted with individual samples of the roses
from each bouquet. Next to the screen sits a
small humpback chest, its corners bound with
tin and its lock of brass [Average lock; chest 43
gp]. In the top lies a woolen wrap woven in
zigzag stripes in the colors of autumn leaves:
brown, deep red, orange and golden yellow [3
gp]. Pinned to it is a brooch of gold knotwork [45
gp]. Below this is a small, polished wood box
with a silver latch [2 gp]. When you open it, the
exquisite fragrance of roses wafts up. Inside,
packed in straw, are six elegant cakes of soap [set
6 gp]. They are as smooth as silk, well scented
with roses, and carved on top with the bust of a
beautiful woman. Next to it is a black silken bag
[3 gp] which holds a bracelet made of silver links
and set with four ovals of jade interspersed with
five pairs of small round pieces of green aventurine
[598 gp]. Also in the pouch is a pin with
numerous silver swirls, shaped into an elaborate
knot and accented with a round polished piece
of turquoise in the center and five smaller ones
set evenly around it [70 gp]. A well made leather
belt pouch [3 gp] contains a large handful of
coins [28 gp, 112 sp, 247 cp]. [Total 1,003.67 gp]
42 Against the wall leans a square wooden frame
with a circular silver mirror in the center of it
[146 gp]. Bouquets of garden flowers are painted
in a symmetrical pattern around the mirror. The
outer portion of the frame has intricately carved
molding, gilded so it glows in the light. Beside it
sits a wooden box [2 gp] with a lid that lifts off.
Inside the box are two items packed carefully in
straw and scraps of cloth. One is a round porcelain
jar, just over a hand-span in height and
diameter, with the glossy finish of polished ivory
[47 gp]. The jar has a slight pedestal for a base,
and scrolled handles. More scrollwork bedecks
the sides covered with gold leaf. The rounded lid
has a raised, pointed handle also tipped in gold.
The jar holds a soft blue bag [2 sp] lying on top
of a pile of silver coins [19 pp, 417 sp]. Inside the
bag is a flower brooch with a double layer of silver
petals and a cluster of blue crystals in the
center [deep blue quartz; brooch, 265 gp]. Rows of
smaller gems are set around the edge of each
petal. The other carefully packed item is an elegant
fluted glass vase with a slender beaded stem
[21 gp]. It is as tall as a man’s forearm, and large
enough to hold an entire bouquet of flowers.
Among the cloth scraps which fill the vase you
glimpse a slender silver chain. Lifting it, you see
it supports a small pink rose carved of mother of
pearl. From it drops a pear-shaped pearl in a lustrous
pink [287 gp]. [Total 999.9 gp]
43 You have entered a plush bedroom, which is [or,
was] decorated luxuriously. There is an antique
dressing table with an oval mirror [125 gp], a
comfortable looking spindle-back chair [30 gp], a
freestanding wooden dresser [55 gp] and a beautiful
bed with silver posts and a down-filled mattress.
Even if you take the time to go through all
of the drawers, look under the bed, and search
the entire room, you find no secret compartments
or hidden treasures. [If the adventurers
examine the bed further:] Upon examination, you
discover the silver bedposts can be removed
from the frame to make it less cumbersome to
carry. You can imagine such a bed as this would
bring a high price if sold to the right buyer. [The
posts and frame can be disassembled to be carried
easier – they weigh 30 pounds each and are made of
pure silver. Silver posts, 175 gp each; intact bed,
800 gp.] If you can find a way to carry all of this
the mother of all treasure tables
72
furniture, you are sure you could earn a nice sum
of money by selling it all, or you could decorate
your own room with fine furnishings. [Total
1,010 gp]
44 You find a collection of five crates, the sort used
for shipping bulk goods. Each one is roughly four
feet long, two feet wide, and two feet high. They
are made of wooden slats with small gaps
between each making it possible, although difficult,
to see what lies inside each one [1 gp each].
Even from this distance you can guess you have
found a collection of spices; you can smell the
aromas of cloves and cinnamon mingling with
other rich scents. Resting on top of the crates is
a large canvas sack [1 sp] filled with pounds of
coins [all from a neighboring kingdom, 211 gp, 412
sp, 587 cp]. A closer inspection of the crates
reveals a blue chalk mark on each one. You can
not make out what it is supposed to be, but it is
likely all of the crates came from the same place
or merchant. Inside the first are three huge bags
of flour, still edible [50 pound bags, 1 gp per bag].
The second and third crates hold spices. You
find a huge sack of cinnamon [50 pounds, 50 gp],
smaller sacks of ginger and pepper [25 pounds, 50
gp each], a barrel of salt [barrel, 2 gp; 50 pounds,
250 gp], a small bag of cloves [10 pounds, 150 gp],
and a sack of saffron [5 pounds, 75 gp]. The
fourth crate holds two bales of cotton, unspun,
still clean and smelling of cloves from the neighboring
crate [5 gp each]. The final crate contains
three bolts of linen [5 square yards each; 20 gp per
bolt] and a bolt of red silk [5 square yards; 50 gp].
[Total 1,013.17 gp]
45 In a man-high box [8 gp] you find a warm, fuzzy
brown wool blanket [5 sp], a heavy crossbow of
pale wood [50 gp], two dozen blond arrows for a
shortbow [not for the crossbow, 12 sp] and an eating
knife with an ivory handle [5 gp]. A large
brass hunting horn as tall as a tall human [60 gp]
is wedged diagonally just above a greatsword
[200 gp] with a hilt gleaming with three smooth
red stones like drops of blood [carnelians]. A
greataxe crosses under the horn, its hilt dark
wood painted with runes [protections or boasts;
20 gp]. On the bottom is a fat white candle [1
cp], an oak leaf, delicately made of silver on a
rough copper chain [35 gp], a silver candleholder
[146 gp] set with sparkling gems [4 pieces of
rock crystal] and a square of metal, in side view
“T” shaped. The metal piece has a design
inscribed on the broad top of the T. [This stamps
the design into whatever it is an artisan makes; 2
gp.] Also on the bottom are a metal comb, with
a clear round stone set on the back [silver with
quartz, 19 gp], a set of leather straps with rocks
tied on them [bolas, 5 gp] and several hundred
loose coins [162 gp, 221 sp, 452 cp] and a dozen
or more gems [7 turquoise and 4 malachite, 10 gp
each; 2 chalcedony and 1 onyx, 50 gp each]. [Total
1,000.33 gp]
46 There is a crack in the wall, with a hole at the
bottom, possibly inhabited by some sort of
rodent. A light shows the gleam of loose coins
inside. You pull out handful after handful of gold
and silver coins [191 gp, 458 sp] and find a few
other shiny objects mixed in with them. There
are three rings: one made of pure gold [30 gp],
another of silver with a large pink pearl placed
in an intricate setting [237 gp], and the last
made of platinum with a small violet garnet in
an even more intricate setting [421 gp]. You also
discover a wide gold bracelet [85 gp] in the
cache. [Total 1,009.8 gp]
47 You find a small, heavy bench with clawed feet
and a single drawer set into the seat [450 gp].
Each of the bench’s four feet is shaped like an
eagle’s leg with the talons clutching a ball of polished
marble the size of an orange. The legs
themselves are gilded wood, and at their tops
the eagles’ legs become wings. These wings are
gilded and extend along the frame on all sides of
the bench. The seat of the bench—supported by
the frame of golden wings—is upholstered in
deep burgundy velvet with tiny marble buttons.
A drawer with a gold knob shaped like a lion’s
head is tucked into the frame sliding out
smoothly at the slightest tug. Inside the drawer
are a masterwork flute with marble accents [130
gp], a child-sized silver bracelet graced with a
green spinel [160 gp], a scroll case containing
five sheets of paper painted with gold leaf along
its top edge [3 gp each], a silver pendant with a
teardrop-shaped pale blue moonstone [100 gp], a
scattering of coins [4 pp, 14 gp] and a silver whistle
on a slender silver chain [90 gp]. The whistle
is decorated with tiny chips of jade, and bears a
carving of a whippoorwill. [Total 999 gp]
48 You find a long warm cloak made from a
bearskin, very well made and lined in pale yellow
silk [100 gp], three short swords [75 gp each]
in sheaths [3 gp each] and a roll of parchment
longer than the swords. The parchment unrolls
to show a large map. On it are painted the countryside
[in the immediate area or of a well mapped
place] showing villages, roads, rivers and hills.
The writing is not the common language [DC 18
to recognize the language of a particularly unfriendly
country or race; 5 gp]. The three short swords
are in green-dyed sheaths on green leather belts
[1 gp each]. The swords are all slightly different.
One has the hilt carved in a representation of a
dog, while the others portray a lion and a doltable
V: 1,000 gold pieces
73
phin. Each sword also has a gem on its pommel:
jasper, rose quartz and bloodstone, respectively.
A nearly black leather backpack [2 gp] holds two
bottles of wine [medium quality; 4 gp each]
wrapped in wool rags, and a pouch with dried
fruit, a handful of roasted almonds, three hardcooked
eggs and three big pieces of crystallized
sugar [food 3 sp]. Below those, a gold armband
shaped like a dragon stares at you, its expression
fierce and its claws out [40 gp]. Light wood pan
pipes [3 gp], a dagger with an azurite in the pommel
[13 gp], a gold-embellished carved drinking
horn [cow’s horn; 40 gp], and a necklace of gold
and chrysoberyls [5 chrysoberyls; necklace 550 gp]
fill the rest of the pack. Loose coins clank at the
bottom [9 sp, 63 cp]. [Total 999.83 gp]
49 A large oak barrel [2 gp] makes for a sizable, if
unwieldy, treasure chest. This one is only partially
filled, with a large amount of space left for
more loot. A rapier in a scabbard pokes out of
the pile. It is well made, and has a trio of small,
black gems [onyx] set into the hilt [masterwork
rapier; 395 gp]. Resting on top are a pair of
spiked gauntlets [5 gp each] and a hard leather
case with brass buckles and clasps [5 gp]. Inside
the case are 10 darts [5 sp each]. These items sit
on top of a hooked net folded carefully and
ready to be used [20 gp]. Beneath this is a suit of
studded leather armor, which has been recently
cleaned and oiled [masterwork armor, 175 gp].
The armor is sized for a typical human female,
although an elf or half-elf could wear it comfortably.
Tucked inside one sleeve of the armor is a
small purse holding a decent number of platinum
pieces [13 pp]. Beneath the studded leather
is a small box made of fragrant wood [cedar] and
inlaid with ivory pieces. When the box is
opened, a series of visible gears begin winding
and the box plays a short traditional song slowly,
with light, tinkling notes [clockwork music
box, 95 gp]. Next to the music box is a cloth belt
with four pouches sewn onto it. The belt seems
to be designed to fit under clothing and armor
[concealable money belt, 1 gp]. It is surprisingly
heavy when lifted; the buckled pouches each
hold double handfuls of gold coins [174 gp].
[Total 1,012 gp]
50 There is a large open box of oak with iron fastenings
[1 gp] under a solid oak table [2 gp]
whose polished surface holds two clay jugs with
dual arched handles. The jugs have been glazed
with a blue and white swirl pattern [8 cp each].
There is also a large wooden bowl [12 cp], four
wooden plates [2 cp each], and four brass spoons
with a pointed leaf design engraved upon the
handles [1 sp each]. In the big box, under a rich
cape of moose fur with an ermine collar [50 gp],
you find a two short swords with brass tips and
brass bands around the scabbards. Their hilts are
brown leather wrapped with brass wire, the
pommels are round disks and the crosspieces are
oval shaped [10 gp each]. With these are two daggers
with teardrop-shaped brass pommels and
flat, leaf-shaped crosspieces which look like vine
leaves growing out of the hilt [2 gp ea], and a
brass cup with an etching of a horse head on it
[1 sp]. These items rest upon a bed of mixed
coinage [30 pp, 524 gp, 808 sp, 1,608 cp]. [Total
998.74 gp]
51 There is a shelf mounted on the wall upon
which several shiny, sparkly items are set.
Looking closer, you can see these objects are primarily
made from crystal or glass and are very
attractive. [All of these items are quite fragile and
will easily be chipped or broken into pieces by rough
contact, such as being dropped onto the floor.] The
largest item, in the middle of the display, is a
bowl perhaps the length of a forearm in diameter
and deep enough to hold a couple dozen
apples or pears. The bowl is engraved with
numerous illustrations of angels, winged sylphs
and leafy bowers [250 gp]. Arranged on either
side of the bowl are three crystal goblets [six
total, 30 gp each] which are also engraved, this
time with images of cheerful-looking little devils
playfully wielding charming little tridents.
Facing you on the right-hand side is a particularly
sparkly statue of two dolphins disporting
themselves [275 gp]. At the other end is another
crystal statue, this one depicting a chariot
pulled by four winged and wild-maned horses
and driven by a hooded character who manages
to control the vehicle while also wielding a
scythe in one hand and a large hourglass in the
other. [This character represents Time; 300 gp.]
[Total 1,005 gp]
52 A large throne sits at the back of this room. As
you make your way toward it you take note of
the rug lying in front of it. It is obviously a finely
crafted work of art which must have taken
months to create. It is multi-hued with lines of
color intersecting to form a cacophony of swirls
and spinning designs—almost enough to make
one dizzy [rug, 10 feet long by 3 feet wide; 110 gp].
The throne itself appears to have been carved
rather than built; it looks to be made from a single
piece of light-colored wood. The carvings are
speckled with numerous small gems, many blue
but also a few orange-red and greenish stones
[intact throne, 910 gp]. [If the adventurers decide to
take the jewels only:] You begin to pry the jewels
out of the throne with a knife. It takes some
time but you finally retrieve them all. Each one
is small, but there are so many of them, it seems
the mother of all treasure tables
74
they must be worth a small fortune [25 blue
quartz,4 gp each; 5 carnelians, 20 gp each; 5 tourmalines,
40 gp each]. [Total 1,020 gp]
53 The box [2 gp] is old. It is thick wood reinforced
with black iron. The wrought iron clasp is closed
but there is no lock. Inside you find a small ironbound
round wooden shield, painted white [10
gp] and just below it, its blade wrapped in a
ragged piece of brown cloth, is a scimitar with a
dark curved and serrated blade [220 gp]. The
light reflects from two vivid purple stones in the
pommel of the scimitar [amethysts]. A white silk
cloth [450 gp] of a size to cover a generous table
drapes over everything else in the box. The
cloth is heavy with silver-thread embroidery and
small, roundish pearls; the pattern portrays
seashells on a beach. Removing the stiff cloth
from the box, you find it also holds a polished,
dark wood flute [5 gp], an egg-shaped painted
wooden doll, an ivory comb and a cloth sack.
The quaint wooden doll comes apart to reveal
another inside it, and another… there are eight
in all and the last holds a smooth round amber
bead [bead, 100 gp; matryoshka or nesting dolls, 15
gp]. The comb has carvings on its surface showing
tiny unicorns at play, tossing balls made of
inset amber [150 gp]. A worn hemp sack [1 sp]
fills one corner of the box bottom. It holds a red
woolen hat [4 sp], a pair of gray woolen mittens
[pair 5 cp] and a small knife with a wooden handle
[1 gp]. Inside one mitten you find more than
two hundred coins [23 gp, 92 sp, 218 cp]. [Total
987.93 gp]
54 Atop a pile of items lies a huge folded bundle of
sturdy yellow canvas. Folded, the bundle is
about an arm’s length both directions. The edges
bend down so you really cannot tell what is
under it. [The yellow cloth is bulky and awkward;
moving it may damage delicate things beneath it.
DC 22 to move it without knocking about the
arrows and shortspears.] The very large piece of
canvas unfolds to be triangular and longer than
twice a man’s height, with reinforced holes at
the corners [a sail; 80 gp]. Under the cloth you
find a longbow [75 gp], a score of arrows [1 gp]
and a dozen shortspears [1 gp each] lying loose
across two barrels. Beside the barrels on the
ground are a hip-length silk cloak of deep purple
[55 gp], a coil of silk rope [50 feet; 10 gp], two
boots and a flat leather pouch [2 gp]. The barrels
hold good red wine [75 gp each]. The boots are
showy black dress boots with complex tooling,
exaggerated heels and rather pointed toes [100
gp]. Near the top edge on the outside, each has a
row of four green stones [malachite]. In the pouch
are two ivory-handled throwing daggers [3 gp
each], an exquisitely detailed rosebud done in
gold, the size of a real rose and backed with a pin
so it can be worn [118 gp], a silver box [2 gp]
holding a thick, bitter-smelling [and tasting]
powder [powdered willow bark, a headache medicine;
2 gp], a delicate dagger with an ivory hilt
set with a small black pearl [300 gp], various
coins [32 gp, 122 sp, 987 cp] and one pale round
gem [moonstone, 50 gp]. [Total 1,017.07 gp]
55 Inside a rotten sack is a cabbage-sized package
wrapped in old and tatty parchment. Opening
the package reveals a death mask [250 gp]: this is
a wooden mask designed to be placed over the
face of a corpse which is to be laid in a sarcophagus.
The base is wood, studded with a dozen
semi-precious pieces of lapis lazuli and agate.
Death masks usually indicate something of the
character of the person for whom it is intended
to be used. This one has a feline cast to it, with
high cheekbones and slanted eyes. The eyebrows
are represented as having been plucked
and the lips rouged. The lower side of the mask,
which rests against the skin, is covered with
glyphs of an unknown sort but which presumably
have a religious purpose. Covered by the
death mask is a skull made from leaded glass
[500 gp]. The skull seems to be human in shape
and the glass is flawless and quite exquisite. The
very faintest of inscriptions on the bottom rear
of the skull bears the name “Annalisa”.
Searching further through the sack reveals a
canvas bag which holds a cache of thumb-sized
ceramic pots sealed with corks. There are five
such pots and each one contains a compound of
ground herbs which is both fragrant and also is a
powerful stimulant to male stamina [40 gp each].
The canvas bag also has a secret compartment
sewn into its bottom which contains a single
small green stone [spinel, 50 gp]. [Total 1,000 gp]
56 A sarcophagus rests here. Etchings all along the
casket tell the story of a great warrior, and the
battles he fought against many foul beasts. The
lid is very heavy. [It will take more than one person
to lift it off the casket. If the adventurers are not
extremely careful in removing the lid:] The lid falls
to the ground with a great crashing sound and
shatters into thousands of pieces. It creates a
vast cloud of dust obscuring your vision for a few
seconds. [The game master may decide whether this
sound alerts people or creatures in the vicinity.]
Inside the sarcophagus is one of the most
impressive suits of armor you have ever seen.
The odd thing is there are no bones, just the
armor. It looks as if the dead hero depicted in
the etchings was not buried in this sarcophagus.
Where the head should be sits a silver helmet
etched with the likeness of a bull on each side
[55 gp]. Beside the helm lies a set of banded mail
table V: 1,000 gold pieces
75
armor. You can tell just by looking at it this
armor was forged by a master craftsman [masterwork
armor; 400 gp]. Lastly, sitting near the
knees of the armor is a stunning tower shield
which must have been made by the same master
smith. It echoes the bull from the helmet and
the animal is surrounded by a wide ring of gold
smelted right into the shield [masterwork shield;
430 gp]. When you lift the shield you find something
else lying under it: a golden brooch lies
between the legs of the armor. It is thick and
formed into the detailed likeness of a bull’s head
[99 gp], with a small, deep purple gem for an eye
[amethyst]. [Total 984 gp]
57 The room is dominated by a huge woolen tapestry
[250 gp] portraying a king [a local one from the
recent past] returning to his capitol in glory after
a battle. [Removal of the tapestry reveals a small,
unlocked vault on the wall behind it.] The vault
opens easily, revealing a cache of items. On top
is a bolt of undyed linen fabric [5 square yards, 4
gp each]. Resting below this, you locate an
etched silver box [220 gp] with four small
amethysts set into the lid. Opening the box
reveals 10 sheets of gold leaf paper [1 gp each],
three of which have been folded into origami
swans. Next to the box is a scroll case made of
very tough, greenish leather [alligator skin, 3 gp].
Opening this exposes a small rolled oil painting
of a young girl looking out the window of a
country house [35 gp; the girl is no one in particular].
Lying under the case is a purse made of supple
leather [1 gp]. It clinks noisily when you lift
it and contains a large collection of coins
including a sizable number of platinum pieces
[all from the local kingdom, 31 pp, 40 gp, 80 sp].
On the bottom of the vault lies a leather satchel
with a long shoulder strap [2 gp]. Inside are two
silk shirts [10 gp each], which look to be sized for
a human child or halfling; a pair of woolen
trousers [1 gp]; and a large silver brooch [85 gp]
in the shape of a cat. It has two greenish gemstones
[citrine] set for its eyes. [Total 1,005 gp]
58 The room has one particularly bizarre feature: a
stuffed and mounted tiger in mid-snarl ready to
pounce. Whoever deemed the animal worthy of
mounting either misjudged, or simply did a poor
job of creating it. The poor beast has several
slashes across its back and chest; these have
been badly concealed by the taxidermist. Still, if
you can manage to get it home, it might have
value to someone [50 gp]. [If the characters
attempt to lift the stuffed tiger, it is far heavier than
it looks, and is quite unwieldy. It also rattles oddly,
as if packed with something other than sawdust.] A
little further investigation reveals a taxidermy
job which may be better than you realized.
Along the spine of the tiger is a thin seam delicately
stitched with thread. A few flicks of a
dagger [or knife or other bladed weapon], and the
truth is revealed—the tiger is actually a
makeshift safe of sorts. Piled on top of the mass
of coins [256 gp, 845 sp, 1151 cp] is a small
wooden box with a clasp. The box has two
tracks of holes drilled into it. Opening it reveals
an illuminated deck of playing cards and six
small wooden pegs [cribbage board, 10 gp]. You
also find a locked gauntlet [right hand, 8 gp]
clutching a heavy mace [12 gp]. Underneath
some of the coins is a stained glass oil lamp [30
gp], a pair of punching daggers with grips fashioned
of bone [5 gp each] and a small jewelry box
[5 gp] containing seven irregular green stones
the size of a large olive [uncut jade, 75 gp each].
[Total 1,002.01 gp]
59 A backpack [worn but useable, 2 gp] rests on the
floor. A coil of fine silk rope [50 feet, 10 gp]
hangs from one side. Strapped to the other side
is a quiver of arrows, all with black fletching [20
arrows, all masterwork, 121 gp]. Opening the
backpack you find a very fine blue silk robe [75
gp] wrapped around a pair of white-embroidered
blue slippers [20 gp]. Beneath these is a pair of
suede gloves with gold stitching and accents [10
gp]. Tucked inside one of the gloves is a small
mahogany box [3 gp], which holds an elaborately
illustrated set of playing cards [15 gp]. Lying
under the gloves is a small gameboard, hinged in
the middle, folded in half and closed with a
small clasp. The board has alternating squares of
ivory and obsidian [128 gp]. Opening the clasp
reveals the felt-lined interior holding 32 miniature
playing-pieces, 16 of ivory and 16 of obsidian
[3 gp each]. Resting along the side of the
backpack’s interior is a fine leather case [2 gp].
Inside is an ornamental pair of carved wooden
nunchaku [15 gp] connected by a silver chain;
they do not seem to be functional as a weapon.
The nunchaku rattle as if something is loose
inside. [Each has a false bottom, which can be easily
unscrewed.] Inside the first are four white
stones [moonstones] about the size of a child’s
thumbnail [60 gp each]. The other side hides a
delicate platinum necklace [91 gp]. In two
pouches [1 gp each] at the bottom of the pack is
a collection of gold and silver coins [from the
same kingdom, 160 gp, 78 sp]. [Total 997.8 gp]
60 You notice a recess in the wall. Looking inside,
it is deep enough you cannot see anything without
more light. [If someone lifts a light to the hole:]
When you hold a light up to the hole you can
see a medium-sized bag inside [1 sp]. You pull it
out and quickly discover it is filled with coins
[105 gp, 2,395 sp]. However, the bag was not the
the mother of all treasure tables
76
only thing in the hole. You next pull out a single,
spiked gauntlet. This seems to be no ordinary
gauntlet. The spikes have a polished silver
gleam, and the gauntlet itself is unexpectedly
light [mithral; 505 gp]. You check one more time
in the deep recess and find another, smaller bag.
You hear metal on metal as you open it to find
six golden shuriken [25 gp each]. Each shuriken
has a small etching of a dragon on it, and you
can not tell if these throwing weapons were
meant to be ceremonial or actually used in battle.
[Total 999.6 gp]
61 You find a wooden cabinet with one door hanging
loose on its hinges [450 gp]. The cabinet
stands twice as wide as a man and nearly as tall,
and even with the damaged door it is clearly
quite valuable. Each hinged door boasts a
knurled marble handle, and tiny ivory carvings
of fashionable noble ladies are inlaid across both
doors. A silver serving platter sits atop the cabinet
[140 gp]; lying on their sides on the platter
are two slightly dented silver goblets with marble
stems [50 gp each]. Inside the cabinet are
three shelves. Carefully folded sets of clothes
occupy the top two shelves: two brightly colored
noble’s outfits of dresses and all the accessories,
including long gloves [75 gp each]; two sets of silvery
cleric’s vestments [5 gp each], and a travelstained
explorer’s outfit [10 gp]. The bottom
shelf holds three glass bulbs of what looks like
water, each with a holy symbol painted on it
[holy water, 25 gp each; the symbol is of a god of
healing], along with a heavy mace [65 gp]. A ring
of iron flanges forms the mace’s head, which
attaches to a shaft of silver-banded oak; its grip
is wrapped in sweat-stained red leather with a
scaled pattern [dragon skin], and the oaken pommel
is in the shape of a roaring bear’s head.
[Total 1,000 gp]
62 You find a large trunk [10 gp], suitable for travel
by carriage. It is too heavy and bulky to carry
easily. It opens without effort, and was apparently
packed for a trip to a cold region. The interior
of the trunk is divided down the center. The
left half is filled with clothing sized and styled
for a female elf, although a particularly short
human could wear the clothing easily. All of it is
flawlessly stitched and carefully maintained and
consists of heavy woolen blouses and pants [5
cold weather traveler’s outfits, 8 gp each], thick leggings
[4 extra leggings, 5 sp each], fur-trimmed
woolen cloaks with an inner lining [3 cloaks, 50
gp each], a sable scarf with wool lining [78 gp]
and two pairs of fur lined boots [15 gp each]. The
right side of the trunk holds three heavy woolen
blankets, all light gray with blue threads running
through them [5 sp each]. Between two of the
blankets rests a fine small harp [masterwork, 400
gp] with a trio of red gems [garnets] set at the top.
A wooden case with an eagle carved into the top
[5 gp] rests under the blankets; its padded interior
houses a beautifully-fashioned tea [or coffee]
service, which includes a serving pot, cream
pitcher, sugar bowl, and six thin silver spoons
[125 gp total]. On the bottom of the trunk, a spell
component pouch [5 gp] contains, not bits of
string and spider webs, but coins separated by
value into the different pockets [63 gp, 87 sp,
108 cp]. A small leather drawstring pouch [5 sp]
holds a complete set of thieves’ tools [30 gp].
Below the pouches sits a long wooden box with
a small clasp. Opening it reveals a complete disguise
kit, which shows no signs of being used [50
gp]. [Total 999.28 gp]
63 You find a copper box about two feet tall and
two feet wide, but only one foot deep [45 gp]. It
is latched but not locked, and opens easily. In
the top rests a good-quality leather cloak [10 gp].
When you lift it out your eyes light upon the
gleam of platinum; a handful of platinum coins
[53 pp] lies on another item of leather. This you
discover to be a pair of excellent leather riding
chaps, sized to fit a person with long legs [7 gp].
Underneath the chaps is another surprise: two
slender bars of gold, each one foot long, rest at
the bottom of the container. Each bar weighs
around 4 pounds and they have no signature
marks of any kind on them [212 gp each]. [Total
1,016 gp]
64 Against the wall rests a silver mirror in a striking
frame shaped like an eight-pointed star [196
gp]. The frame is wooden, with detailed edging,
painted a glossy black and the center space is
more than large enough to show a person’s face.
The four long points stretch an arm’s length
from tip to tip, while the intervening points are
shorter. Beside the mirror stands a pair of elaborate
wrought bronze chairs with rounded, fanlike
backs, and a matching round, three-legged
table [55 gp each]. The metalwork on these is
very intricate and they look as though they
would be at home in a very formal setting. On
the bronze table rests a box made of thin, woven
strips of leather and finished with brass corners,
hinges and latch [16 gp]. It is a hand-span square
and half that tall. In it is a bracelet of hammered
silver squares and rectangles, linked so it is
slightly flexible and sized to fit a woman’s wrist
[6 gp]. Next to the box is a black velvet pouch [3
gp] which holds a substantial silver neck chain,
short but sturdy enough to hold its heavy pendant.
The pendant is a square of hammered silver,
inlaid with rectangles of orange-red, green
and blue stone [carnelian, malachite and lapis
table V: 1,000 gold pieces
77
lazuli; 244 gp]. Another—smaller—black pouch
holds three perfect pink pearls [100 gp each]. In
the bottom of the leather box are loose coins [67
gp, 16 sp, 87 cp]. [Total 999.47 gp]
65 You find saddlebags and a longsword lying next
to a pile of sheepskins, a leather bucket and a
shortbow [30 gp]. The longsword [185 gp] has no
sheath. Its hilt resembles a falcon on a perch,
and five small carnelians drip from the beak like
blood. The three sheepskins [2 gp each] are flat
and lying fleece side up. The simple leather
bucket [1 sp] holds an iron ladle [1 sp] and a
short piece of coarse rope [hemp, 5 feet; 5 cp].
The saddlebags are dark leather [4 gp]. Both are
closed with buckles. The first one holds a heavy
green wool tunic, calf length on a normal
human [1 gp], a pair of thick cowhide gloves [not
quite gauntlets, 1 gp], a bar of hard, dry yellow
soap [5 cp], and a thin blue and gray plaid blanket
[3 sp]. Wrapped in the blanket are three silver
bells [5 gp each]. The bells are attractive and
the sound they make when rung is quite beautiful.
Each bell makes a different note. The second
pack is stuffed with a horseman’s cloak of dark
green wool, the upper part lined in squirrel fur
[slit at the side; 30 gp]. At the bottom of this bag
is a pouch [1 gp] containing a necklace [550 gp]
with five pieces of amber set in gold, a silver ring
[75 gp] with a clear faceted gem [rock crystal] and
a handful of coins [78 gp, 81 sp, 83 cp]. [Total
985.53 gp]
66 In a large box [2 gp] you find a lute of white
wood, with a picture of a maiden under a tree
painted in gold leaf on the belly [masterwork
instrument, 130 gp], and a gray metal brooch
[pewter] set with four large cream-colored stones
[agates; 50 gp]. Beside them is a small, rectangular
box of gray metal with a gold geometric
design on the top [box silver with gold wire, 25 gp].
It has a tiny latch and opens easily. Inside it is
divided into four parts. Two compartments are
empty; a third holds fine powdered crystal, the
other, bits of leaves [spell components for a mage;
components e.g. diamond dust, 100 gp]. A pocketsized
leather book contains the travel journal of
a salesman visiting an unfamiliar city. The prose
is flowery and the writer itemizes every expense
of the trip [tedious or a story clue; 5 sp]. In a polished
wood box you find four ivory dice, a tooled
and oiled leather game board, and eighteen
counters made of black and whites stone [jet and
marble; boxed game set, 450 gp]. Across the center
a nicely balanced rapier [220 gp] with two
deep green gems [spinels] in the handle lies in a
brown leather sheath. A cloth pouch [3 sp] of
coins is the final item in the box [29 gp, 90 sp,
90 cp]. [Total 1,016.7 gp]
67 You find a trunk with a studded leather exterior,
large enough to hold an adult halfling [8 gp].
The trunk is not locked, and inside is everything
a well heeled noble would need for a short journey.
There are two sets of fine clothes, both
made of multicolored silk and trimmed with fur
and gold and silver thread [royal outfits, 200 gp
each], as well as two blue glass bottles of wine in
padded bags [18 gp each] and a short-bladed dagger
with a star rose quartz set into its scabbard
[155 gp]. [The GM may test the characters’ perception,
if desired, before supplying the following information.]
The inside of the chest does not seem as
deep as the outside. A bit of fumbling around
leads to the discovery that the chest has a false
bottom. [The catch of the false bottom should be
fairly easy to discover]. This slides open on oiled
hinges once the catch is triggered, revealing the
tools of an entirely different occupation. In the
hidden section, you find a specially made
satchel, which holds a set of masterwork thieves’
tools [120 gp]; the grip end of each pick is carved
to look like the head of a raven. Also present is
a hand crossbow made of dark wood, its grip also
raven-shaped [110 gp] and two narrow boxes of
bolts [1 gp each]. Beneath three other sets of
clothes—suitable for a court jester [3 gp], a peasant
[1 sp] and a priest [of a good faith; 5 gp],
respectively—are two other items: a small case
containing three signet rings [perhaps of noble
lines that have died out; 5 gp each], four blocks of
sealing wax [1 gp each], and a sack of coins [122
gp, 199 sp]. [Total 1,000 gp]
68 There is a huge chest of oak [5 gp] with a rounded
lid and black iron fastenings and supports. It
has a great iron ring on each end and two more
on either side to assist in lifting it. Coins are
scattered on the ground around the chest [15 pp,
12 gp, 17 sp, 25 cp]. It looks as if the coins were
dropped by someone in a great hurry. The massive
chest itself is bound in iron. When you
open it you see it holds bags of coins, but it is significantly
less then half full. Most of the sacks
are tied but a few have been opened and not
retied; some stray coins are spilled among the
bags. Careful inspection reveals there are fifteen
bags [2 sp each] of copper pieces [600 cp each];
another ten bags [2 sp each] contain silver [a total
of 6,456 sp]. Scattered among the bags are a few
hundred loose coins [1 pp, 16 gp, 682 sp, 125 cp].
If there was anything else here, it is gone now.
[Total 1,005 gp]
69 In the treasure is a bastard sword with fine
chrysoberyl in the hilt [150 gp] in a taupe leather
sheath [2 gp], and a large pillow [2 feet x 2 feet]
covered in lightweight greenish wool [4 sp]. A
shoulder pouch of fine dark doeskin [4 gp] is
the mother of all treasure tables
78
draped over the pillow. A heavy, polished wood
club—the grip wrapped in pale leather [3 gp]—
and a spiked iron chain [25 gp] lie beside the pillow.
A conch-shell horn, reinforced and embellished
with silver [15 gp; DC 22 to blow it and
hear the tone], and a much smaller pouch of golden
leather [2 sp] lie on the ground beyond the
pillow. In the shoulder bag you find four small
pies filled with beef gravy and carrots [1 sp each];
eight large pieces of dried apple [1 cp]; a leather
water flask with a tight-fitting waxed cork [mostly
full, 2 sp]; a simple silver bowl without handles,
large enough to hold a meal [2 gp]; and a silver
spoon and eating knife [110 gp each], each
with a red garnet in its handle. The little pouch
has two halves. One holds a slim red leather
book with gold lettering [fourteen commonly used
prayers to the sun god/goddess; 25 gp]. The other
half of the pouch holds coins [9 gp, 213 sp, 305
cp]. [If the adventurers pour out the coins:] You also
discover a thin gold ring [520 gp] with an oval
blue gem [blue spinel]. [Total 1,000.56 gp]
70 A barrel [oak, 2 gp] contains a walking cane of
fine wood, with a handle in the form of a horse
[2 gp], an elegant umbrella made of orange silk [5
gp] and a fine steel short sword in a black leather
sheath embellished with white-painted dragons
[5 gp]. The sword hilt is a riot of color, with
seven gems in as many shades [malachite, lapis
lazuli, carnelian, moonstone, citrine, tigereye and
obsidian; short sword 225 gp]. Plain linen [1 yard,
4 gp] is wrapped around a hand-high crystal vase,
which is delicately beautiful [148 gp]. A large
leather-bound book is wedged beside it. The
book is a work of art with fine leather covers
highlighted in gold leaf, but it has been heavily
used. It is a classic work on the physics of magic
[100 gp]. A large silver bowl with decorative
designs cut out along the rim [46 gp] holds a pile
of two-tined silver forks [18; 5 gp each], a pair of
fine, white calfskin gloves for small hands [5 gp],
and a small stuffed toy dog—very worn—with
jeweled eyes and a gem on its collar [obsidian
eyes, red-brown garnet on the collar; stuffed dog,
120 gp]. You have to tug to get the bowl and
book out, but under them you find a soft pouch
[5 sp] containing a butterfly, cut of green quartz
[40 gp]; a silver and gold holy symbol [to a god
who protects travelers; 50 gp]; an onyx medallion
[142 gp] and coins [23 gp, 57 sp, 122 cp]. [Total
1,014.42 gp]
71 You find a sturdy wooden case with steel caps on
the corners and a worn brass clasp [5 gp]. The
clasp opens easily revealing a complete alchemsist’s
lab, which has definitely seen some use, but
nonetheless has been maintained perfectly [500
gp]. The inside of the case lid has been modified
to act as a combination storage compartment and
showcase for the various alchemical items. In one
pouch, you find two flasks of alchemist’s fire [20
gp each]. The next pocket holds two slim vials of
antitoxin [50 gp each]. In the center, strapped
down with bands of wire, are four flasks of acid
[10 gp each]. In the two rightmost pockets you
find groups of tindertwigs tied together in batches
of 10 [20 tindertwigs in all, 1 gp each] and three
smokesticks [20 gp each]. In a small velvet pouch
[5 sp] is a pair of thunderstones [30 gp each], each
wrapped in muslin cloth. The lab itself, while
cushioned by the padded sides of the container,
seems to fit poorly. [It will take a little work to
remove the lab from the box, but if the heroes do lift
the lab out of the box they will discover: ] In the false
bottom of the box you find a leather purse [1 gp]
filled with coins, mostly gold and silver [from a
nearby kingdom, 75 gp, 112 sp] and 10 velvet
pouches similar to the one holding the thunderstones
[5 sp each]. Each of these holds a flask or
vial, most of them empty [5 vials, 1 gp each; 5
flasks, 3 cp each]. One flask holds one dose of Oil
of Taggit [an ingested poison causing unconsciousness;
90 gp]. [Total 1,012.85 gp]
72 The first thing catching your eye is a framed portrait
of a small boy. He is dressed in formal
clothes, standing with his arms around the neck
of a great hound. The workmanship of the
painter is good but not extraordinary [10 gp], but
the elaborate walnut frame is a nice piece of
craftsmanship [14 gp]. Supporting the painting
you find a riding saddle [10 gp] and a box. The
box is longer than a man’s arm, made of wood
covered in green-stained leather and decorated
with gold leaf designs [19 gp]. The box opens
with a latch to reveal, lying on green silk, a
matched pair of rapiers [170 gp each] with silver
and gold in the guards, and a bright gem [tourmaline]
in each pommel. A large loosely woven
sack lying nearby [1 sp] holds a priest’s blue robe
[5 gp], a long red woolen tunic [1 gp], and a
leather cloak generously trimmed with rabbit fur
[12 gp]. Below those you find a bullseye lantern
[12 gp], six darts [5 sp each], a long leather belt [5
sp] with a copper buckle [25 cp], a heavy
warhammer with a leering face crudely carved
into the haft [12 gp] and a lady’s fan of ivory and
feathers [60 gp]. A pouch holds a small cheese,
several little breads [hard rolls] and an apple [food
8 cp]. Loose at the bottom of the sack is a pile of
coins [18 gp, 25 sp, 1,002 cp]. Mixed in with
these is a pair of gold, teardrop shaped earrings
[pair 38 gp] and a gold ring with four fine
amethysts [451 gp]. [Total 1,018.45 gp]
73 The chest of drawers against the wall at first
looks to have gone through some terrible contable
V: 1,000 gold pieces
79
flagration, but as you near it, you see this was
merely a trick of the light. In fact, this piece of
furniture [175 gp] is in remarkably good condition;
the wood is a rich dark color, and the handles
on the drawers are made of a polished white
material [marble]. This item would not look out
of place in the home of a wealthy merchant or
even minor nobility. There are two small drawers
at the top of the chest and three large drawers
below. The top left drawer holds a small roll
of felt and a small roll of canvas. Unrolled, the
canvas proves to be five oil paintings, all beautiful
renderings of the same woman in different
places around a large country manor. Each
painting is one foot square, and none are signed
by the artist [50 gp each]. The small roll of felt
contains basic woman’s jewelry; a silken ribbon
choker beaded with freshwater pearls [58 gp]
and teardrop earrings of gold vermeil with
spherical yellow-green gems [citrine, 125 gp for
the pair]. The top right drawer holds more than a
few handfuls of gold coins [277 gp]. It should
come as no surprise that the bottom three drawers
are all filled with clothing. The first drawer
holds a collection of hosiery and underclothes,
all of which feels to be made of high quality silk.
The next drawer down contains three flowery
blouses, embroidered and trimmed with delicate
lace; three unadorned linen tunics; a single fine
linen nightshirt embroidered with roses around
the collar; and two long silk dresses trimmed
with white lace. The final drawer holds three
pairs of pants, all made of high-quality light
wool; and four pairs of silk dancing slippers, each
a different color. All of the clothing is sized for a
short, stocky dwarven woman [4 courtier outfits,
30 gp each]. [Total 1,005 gp].
74 Sitting on the floor is a massive wooden chest [5
gp] banded with corroded strips of iron and
wrapped in a rusty chain [5 gp]. The wood is
warped and stained with rust from the chains,
and all of the chest’s fittings are encrusted with
salt, as though it had spent a long time underwater.
As one of the chain links has rusted
through, removing the bindings is a simple task.
Opening the lid yields the strong smell of sea
salt overlaid with a faint odor of rot and decay.
Inside the chest are the remains of two longdead
dwarves, now little more than skeletons
with scraps of leathery skin hanging off their
bones. Their wrists and ankles are shackled with
rusted sets of manacles [4 sets, 10 gp each], and
their beards look to have been cut off and tied
around their throats before they were put into
the chest [a great insult in dwarven culture].
Although they are dressed in salt-stained rags,
both skeletons are wearing jewelry. Each wears a
heavy silver chain with a gold medallion on it
[two medallions and chains, 85 gp each], as well as
rings on the index fingers of both hands. The
medallions look to be ancient gold coins, worn
almost beyond recognition; you can just barely
make out the head of a dwarf wearing a plumed
helmet [these are coins minted by a now-extinct
clan of dwarves]. The dwarves wear a matched set
of rings. On the index finger of the right hand,
both have silver rings etched with a mountain
range, double doors set into the top of the tallest
mountain; each door is picked out with two
bloodstones [270 gp each]. The index finger of
the left hand bear a ring are made of well worn
brass, set with a single brilliant tourmaline; they
are otherwise unadorned [120 gp each]. [Total
1,000 gp]
75 You see a chaise lounge covered in exquisitely
woven fabric [or damask] in a beautiful forest
green shade [130 gp]. You could imagine a lovely
lady reclining on it, but it would have to be a
very small lady, as the chaise is only as long as
your arm, and a little higher than your knee.
[Perhaps it is the possession of a gnome princess, or
a pampered wealthy child.] On the chaise are two
wooden boxes. One is a carefully made box
about forearm’s-length wide and tall and about
half that deep [3 gp]. You open it to find the contents
wrapped very carefully in wool.
Unwrapping the top item, you feel what seems
to be a wine goblet. When you finally see it, you
discover it has a very long stem and no foot at
all. There is no sign of it being broken; it appears
to have been made this way. The box holds half
a dozen of these footless goblets, all in a beautiful
amber shade [12 gp each], with a larger item
beneath them. It is a vase, in the same amber
glass [16 gp]. It narrows slightly at the neck and
is about as tall as the goblet stems are long. [The
goblets are usually stored in the matching container,
looking much like a bouquet of brittle flowers.] The
other box is a slender, polished container of dark
wood [2 gp] holding seven platinum coins [7 pp]
and a black velvet bag [2 gp]. Inside it, a slender
gold hoop, as far across as the length of a lady’s
little finger, hangs from a double strand gold
necklace. Inside the circle is suspended a cluster
of gems [12 garnets of various sizes] looking a little
like a small bunch of gleaming red grapes
[necklace 713 gp]. [Total 1,008 gp]
76 In a chest [2 gp] are a fishing rod [6 sp], a pouch
[5 sp] with three sets of fishhooks and sinkers [3
sp], a sack of apples [10 pounds; 5 sp], a sack of
wheat [10 pounds; 1 sp] and a big wax-covered
circle of cheese [10 pounds, 2 gp]. Below them a
bastard sword [100 gp] with gold wire and six
small blue gems [blue quartz] in the guard and
the mother of all treasure tables
80
hilt lies atop a broad-bladed axe of a length to be
used by a dwarf [dwarven waraxe, 30 gp]. Under
those is a loose sack [1 sp] containing a brown
wool clerical robe [2 gp] and matching cloak [1
gp], a long warm red wool shirt [1 gp], five thick
wool socks for a large person [3 cp each], and a
long, narrow yellow silk scarf [5 feet x 6 inches, 2
gp]. The sack also contains a leather case [1 gp]
with a set of darts [12 darts, 5 sp each], a half circle
of twisted silver wire with one end shaped
into a long pin [cloak pin, 10 gp] and an hourglass
with wooden ends [25 gp]. Individually wrapped
in rags inside the chest you find a silver pitcher
with abstract silver wire decoration [65 gp], a
curved dagger with a clear yellow stone in the
hilt [citrine; 62 gp] and a statue of the lord
[queen] of the gods. The god [goddess] is as long
as your small finger, lovingly carved of amber
and arrayed with gold leaf garments [565 gp]. A
fat pouch in the bottom [2 gp] bulges with coins
[95 gp, 124 sp, 114 cp]. [Total 986.79 gp]
77 Hidden in the back [closet] you find a greatsword
[400 gp], the hilt decorated with a large bloodstone,
which is flanked by four-matched onyx. A
tall blue glass pitcher, blown with great skill into
a graceful shape [20 gp], a leather bag and a box
sit next to the sword. The black leather bag [7
gp] closes with a fancy pewter buckle in the
shape of a fox, and is very heavy [about 65
pounds]. Inside it you find a small linen bag [5
sp]. Within the cloth bag is five pieces of cloth
wrapped around various dried and powdered
minerals and plants [pick your favorite five spell
components; 10 gp]. Below those are six narrow
silver hoops big enough to fit around most wrists
[bracelets], each with a slightly different pattern
in the silver [5 sp each] and a large pile of gold,
silver and copper coins [44 gp, 255 sp, 2991 cp].
The box is hinged with leather and latched with
a wooden pin through a leather thong [2 gp].
Inside you find a folded orange cloth, a holy
symbol on a beaded chain, and a piece of charcoal
wrapped in a scrap of linen [no value]. The
cloth is a tightly folded tunic of very thin orange
silk, long enough to be worn by most humans
[60 gp]. The holy symbol [storm god/goddess; 100
gp] is silver with a small red gem [garnet] on a
chain of prayer beads of clear, yellow, green, blue
and red glass [20 gp]. Under these lies a thin
round piece of glass set in a palm-sized brass
frame with a protruding rod long enough to
grasp [magnifying glass, 100 gp]. Piled in the bottom
of the wooden box are numerous coins [11
pp, 59 gp, 141 sp, 576 cp]. [Total 1,010.77 gp]
78 A chest [2 gp] contains a drum with white
leather heads on both ends and the sides painted
black, small enough to carry easily, and two
wooden drumsticks [5 gp]. There is a also a pair
of gauntlets of undyed heavy cowhide [5 sp], a
fan with silver edging on the ivory openwork of
the blades [15 gp] and a hooded cloak of rich
purple velvet [10 gp]. A reddish wood hand
crossbow [100 gp] lies partly under the cloak.
Bolts for the crossbow are tangled together in a
small pine box [2 cp] without a top. [There are 40
bolts, but only 36 come out of the box undamaged;
36 sp.] A greatsword [100 gp] as tall as a sturdy
human lies beside the crossbow, sheathed in soft
yellow leather with straps for carrying on one’s
back [sheath and straps, 3 gp]. The sword has a
comfortable hilt with a single black gem [onyx]
in the pommel. An old leather sack [3 cp] holds
a ring and a holy symbol. The golden ring [600
gp] is smooth and designed for a large finger, set
with a round black pearl. The holy symbol [to a
god of the sea; 80 gp] is silver adorned with a large
clear moonstone. Loose at the bottom of the
sack are coins [41 gp, 124 sp, 66 cp] and three
small black gems [obsidian, 10 gp each]. [Total
1,003.21 gp]
79 The room is dominated by a large, four-post bed
with a huge canopy. The bed is a deep reddishbrown
color, and despite its age, is free from
marks and damage [cherrywood bed, 100 gp]. The
canopy has not fared as well and shows some
signs of water damage. Despite this, it is still
attractive, and the entire length of the item is
painstakingly embroidered with daily scenes of
castle life [25 gp]. Under the bed are three boxes,
each about two feet wide, a foot high, and four
feet long [3 gp each]. You find clothing in the
first case; it appears to have been used as an
impromptu dresser. All of the clothes are finely
tailored, and will fit a stout man, or with a little
work with a needle and thread, a dwarf. There
are several shirts, three pairs of pants, two jackets,
a waistcoat, stockings, underclothes, and a
light jacket [3 courtier outfits, 30 gp each; 2 extra
shirts, 1 gp each]. Packed with the clothing are
two pair of polished boots, one new [5 gp] and
one well worn [3 gp]. The next box is a little
more promising. Under a stack of blankets [three
total, 5 sp each] and linens [two sets, 3 sp each] is
a jewelry box [3 gp] containing electrum and
agate jewelry. The set consists of a ring [30 gp], a
choker [60 gp], earrings [40 gp], and two
bracelets [35 gp each]. The third box holds a set
of china dishes—service for six—with a light
blue floral pattern [100 gp set]. Also in the box is
a small case [1 gp] with silver flatware [30 pieces,
1 gp each]. [If adventurers check under the mattress:]
Under the mattress are four bags [1 sp
each] of coins [364 gp, 557 sp, 528 cp, 566 cp].
[Total 1,001.14 gp]
table V: 1,000 gold pieces
81
80 You find a cylindrical ivory case, slender and as
long as your arm [32 gp]. It holds a roll of thick,
high-quality paper. When unrolled, the scroll is
nearly four feet long. On it is an exquisite painting
of a long-legged water bird with delicate
shading in the feathers and in the reeds below
[157 gp]. Next to it lies a backpack of mellow
golden leather [2 gp] Inside is a folded piece of
black silk, which proves to be a slender black
dress with laces up the back. It is embroidered
all over in large, openwork flowers in a variety of
colors [92 gp]. Folded with it is a wide belt of soft
black leather [6 gp]. Below, wrapped in a piece of
gray wool [2 sp], is a set of three porcelain
plaques, each about a hand-span square—their
polished white surfaces decorated with delicate
renderings of various wildflowers [set 18 gp]. In
the bottom of the backpack is a cloth pouch [1
sp] of coins [3 pp, 37 gp, 287 sp, 318 cp], a petite
leather pouch [3 sp] with five rose quartz stones
[50 gp each] and another cloth pouch [1 sp] holding
a bracelet. It is made of carnelian beads,
round and smooth in colors ranging from fiery
red to nearly cranberry dark [345 gp]. [Total
1,001.58 gp]
81 You find a lute, intricately inlaid in three colors
of wood [20 gp], two light, repeating crossbows,
painted dark brown [250 gp each] and four ironbound
wooden barrels [2 gp each]. The barrels
hold a common red wine, the spigot openings
conveniently facing outward [20 gp each]. Beside
the barrels sit a large, lidded metal bucket [8 sp]
and a neatly constructed wooden box [1 gp]. The
bucket is two hand spans high and tightly
closed. The lid is difficult to open [DC 25; inside
is red paint, 1 gp]. The box would be large
enough to hold the bucket, and its lid lifts off
easily. Inside you find small soldiers and horses
carved out of wood and carefully painted. The
detail of the carving and painting is impressive.
It looks like a full squadron, foot soldiers and
cavalry. The box also holds supply wagons, with
draft horses and wheels that turn, and matching
monsters, including a red dragon, a hydra and a
wyvern [set 20 gp]. Behind the bucket, a much
smaller, long, narrow, light wood box [5 sp] holds
a bouquet of dried carnations [no value], a heavy
silver bracelet with a single large clear white
stone [moonstone; bracelet 92 gp], a pair of gold
earrings shaped like doves [pair 10 gp] and a gold
ring with a green gem [green spinel; ring 157 gp].
A cloth sack tucked out of sight on the ground
among the wine barrels holds several hundred
coins [76 gp, 218 sp, 347 cp]. [The adventurers
must move the barrels in order to see the sack, which
is likely (but not required) to tap the first barrel to
see what it contains.] [Total 991.57 gp]
82 This room has a high shelf that runs around the
extent of the entire room. [It may be fastened on
to the wall or the top portion of the walls may be
recessed.] You can see several decorative pieces
sitting on the shelf. The first thing to catch your
eye is a replica of a great sailing ship. It is complete
with cloth sails and all the accoutrements
you would expect to see on a large vessel. The
small ship [about two feet long] is expertly
designed [105 gp]. A few feet away from the ship
you spy an old blue-glazed clay jar. You open the
lid to discover it holds gold coins [88 gp]. Still
further along the shelf stands a merchant’s scale
forged from silver. It looks to be very accurate
and is handsomely crafted [weight 4 pounds; 22
gp]. As you continue to scan the shelf you notice
[the remains of] several potted plants which do
not look like they are worth much [5 clay pots; 3
cp each]. Four of the plant pots are neatly lucked
toward the back of the shelf, but the one on the
end sits at the forward edge. [Investigation will
show a sword is lying at the back of the shelf and its
hilt is behind the forward pot.] You discover a
longsword lying near the back of the shelf. It is
a wondrous weapon. Its blade is shining and
sharp, as if it has never seen battle [590 gp]. The
hilt is made of gold, with a beautiful blue spinel
set into the pommel. The last thing visible on
the shelf is a large crystal bowl, radiant in the
light. It is heavy as you lift it and hopefully will
not be too delicate to transport [178 gp]. [Total
983.15 gp]
83 It seems as if you have walked into the collection
of a knife-fancier, for covering the wall is a
multitude of knives in all shapes and sizes, each
one resting on one or more nails driven into the
wall. There are thirteen straight, serrated knives
suitable for cutting or sawing [10 gp each]; fifteen
long thin knives suitable for stabbing [10 gp
each]; six small copper knives with sharp points
but blunt sides [3 gp each]; four meat cleavers,
extremely sharp and suitable for chopping
things ranging in size from frogs’ legs to beef ribs
[20 gp each]; two knives with long and wavy double
blades in dull pewter [10 gp each]; nine
knives which would make useful daggers, made
from iron rather than steel [5 gp each]; a thin
stiletto with a silver handle and a golden blade
[150 gp]; a long-handled kris made from meteoric
iron [50 gp]; a general-purpose kitchen knife
made from whalebone, with pictures of a sailing
ship and mermaids carved into the handle [30
gp]; a toenail-cutting knife with a red handle [2
gp]; and a knife seemingly made from glass,
which is both delicate and pretty [25 gp]. There
is also a set of six cut-throat razors with [should
you wish to test them] suitably sharp edges, differthe
mother of all treasure tables
82
ing in size for shaving gnomes, humans or halfogres
[50 gp each]. [Total 1,000 gp]
84 Something gleams in the corner catching your
eye—a pile of silver. Investigating, you discover
a few dozen silver spikes. Many of them are
stained with a flaky, brownish substance resembling
dried blood. Each is quite heavy; it would
be difficult to carry them all [50 silver spikes, 4
pounds each; 20 gp each]. [Total 1,000 gp]
85 The antique claw foot bathtub in the corner is
made of a reddish ceramic material and has been
decorated with painted fauns and satyrs. The
paint has faded, as has the gold-painted trim, but
the tub still looks functional and beautiful [95
gp]. If the contents are any indication, it also has
not been used as a bathtub in ages. Instead of
water, it holds a small pool of silver coins [2,019
sp] with pieces of armor and small items making
oddly shaped islands. The largest of these is a
suit of breastplate armor complete with spikes
[250 gp]. Resting next to the armor is a heavy
steel shield, also armed with spikes [30 gp] and a
pair of spiked gauntlets [10 gp total]. Confirming
the idea that someone really enjoyed spiked
items is a spiked chain flowing through the mass
of coins [masterwork, 325 gp]. Fortunately, not
everything in the tub is spiked. A large copper
cooking pot [3 gp] lies partially submerged in the
silver, as does a decorative pewter mug with
etched pictures of wolves circling the rim [5 gp].
You also find a weapon, which does not have a
single spike on it; it is an ornamental dagger
with gold filigree on the pommel and a single
moonstone embedded on the sheath [54 gp
total]. Acting as a stopper, keeping the silver
from draining out is a small wooden box [1 gp].
Opening the box reveals a tiny figure carved
from green stone [malachite, 45 gp]. The figure is
of an elven woman brandishing a bow in one
hand and a longsword in the other. It is beautiful,
but her expression is disturbing. [Total
1,019.9 gp]
86 Upon a flat-topped wooden chest of cedar [3 gp]
rests a great two-handed sword, with a dull gray
blade. The hilt is of dark gray steel with two
strands twisted together and capped with a ball
on the end. The guard is made of a single round
bar on two sides of the blade, each ending in a
round ball [50 gp]. A simple latch fastens the
chest and within it you find various items and
four large canvas sacks [4 sp each] of coin [108 sp,
272 cp; 100 sp, 228 cp; 200 gp, 140 sp; 145 gp,
150 sp]. The items include six bedrolls [1 sp each]
of dark green fabric with six winter blankets of
grey [5 sp each]. You also find a roll of ten
beeswax candles [1 cp each] wrapped in a waxed
paper [5 sp]. There is a bottle of good wine [10
gp] and four wineglasses [5 gp], and a silver chalice
with blue quartz stones [110 gp] wrapped in a
yellow silk tablecloth [2 yards, 20 gp]. There is a
silver mirror [25 gp], a noble’s outfit that
includes green breeches, a white lace shirt, and
black waistcoat with small gold buttons, sporting
a short green cape trimmed in gold thread
[75 gp]. In the folds of one of the blankets there
is a small red cloth covered jewelry box with gilt
corners and clasp and a scrimshaw oval on the
lid depicting a stag running through the woods
[75 gp]. It contains a gold necklace with a jade
stone [250 gp]. [Total 1,028.6 gp]
87 You find a canvas sack [5 cp] with old stains on
it like dried blood. Inside are a number of platinum
pieces [37 pp], several of which are also
stained, and three pieces of jewelry with dried
blood in the crevices. There is a plain silver ring
sized for a man [15 gp], a gold ring with a black
pearl which would more likely fit a woman [560
gp] and an anklet made from looping pieces of
silver and gold [45 gp]. [Total 990.05 gp]
88 You find a complete set of half-plate armor
including articulated metal gauntlets and boots
[650 gp]. It would probably be effective in battle,
but clearly has never been used. Every flat surface
is painted with intricate, brightly colored
pictures of knights in similar armor defeating all
manner of enemies. None of the paintings is as
much as scratched. Beside it is a box of well balanced
darts [20 darts, 5 sp each], and a warhorse’s
barding made of padded gray wool, quilted, with
a green, gold, and red phoenix [or other design]
painted all over the sides [30 gp]. There is a roll
of gilded cording long enough to go around a
cottage [50 feet, 5 gp], a jaunty green hat with a
green feather and the brim turned up on the
sides [5 sp] and a mandolin of red-brown wood,
the edges showing signs of hard usage [5 gp].
[When strummed, the mandolin resonates poorly.
Inside is a package of wool scraps [5 cp], large
enough it does not slide when the mandolin is tilted.
It contains a large beryl, 220 gp]. Lying partly
under the mandolin is an iron knife with a good
sharp blade—the handle well carved oak [2
gp]—and an ice pick, the blade tooled of iron
and the haft dark brown wood [maple; ice pick 1
gp]. In an old sack are six ordinary candles [1 cp
each], a magnifying glass with an iron handle
[100 gp] and numerous coins [8 gp, 170 sp, 185
cp]. [Total 1,050.46 gp]
89 A mace of solid iron [12 gp], a war sickle [6 gp],
a silver hunting horn with a high bell-like tone
[30 gp] and a walking cane lie conspicuously at
the top of the treasure. The cane is made of dark
table V: 1,000 gold pieces
83
wood with its handle carved in the shape of a
dog’s head, with red stone eyes and crystal teeth
[2 garnets, 4 small smoky quartz; cane 320 gp].
Below it are three folded cloaks—the first light
gray wool [1 gp], the second very long, of thick
white wool lined in rabbit fur [4 gp], the third
gold-trimmed green silk [75 gp]. In a lidless raw
wood box [3 cp] are a portrait of a pretty child [2
sp], five writing-grade feathers [2 cp each], a tiny
one-bladed knife [penknife, 1 sp] and a wooden
cube larger than a man’s fist. The cube is clearly
a puzzle box [3 gp]: it has nine squares of different
colors per side and a few slide. [If the box is
opened:] Inside the box are jammed a red gem
[spinel, 100 gp], two gold nuggets [30 gp, 50 gp]
and a pair of silver dice [pair 10 gp]. In a small
pouch [5 sp] is a gold bracelet, about a finger’s
length wide but not quite a full circle so it will
fit most wrists. Fantastical animals decorate its
surface [200 gp]. A similar pouch [5 sp] holds
coins [45 gp, 40 sp, 83 cp], half a dozen green
gems [6 malachite, 10 gp each] and a small piece
of amber [50 gp]. [Total 1,002.26 gp]
90 A wooden cupboard is fastened to the wall;
behind its door are three shelves. On the top
shelf sits a glass case [20 gp] with wooden sides
and cover, measuring a half cubit in every
dimension, in which has been arranged a stuffed
wren with a diorama of other preserved insects,
including earthworms and cockroaches. Next to
this glass case is a doll the shape and size of a girl
of about four [300 gp], made from porcelain and
dressed in an excellent blue silk dress and quite
accurate linen underclothes. Her shoes are of
leather with silver buckles and she carries a
small fox fur bag with some boiled sweets inside
which are no longer edible. On the second shelf
is a large wheel of cheese in a rind thick enough
to keep it ripe for many years. [It is still edible and
quite tasty; 50 pounds, 10 gp]. Next to the cheese
are three bottles of wine of a famous vintage
from a well-known vineyard [50 gp each]. There
is also a packet of thin, dry waybread which has
long since become inedible [no value]. On the
bottom shelf is a small and beautifully presented
packet of papers printed with woodcuts, depicting
erotic acts involving women from distant
lands with, apparently, little sense of shame [210
gp]. Underneath the prints is a lute made from
pale, fine-grained wood and with strings of the
best quality of catgut [masterwork, 300 gp]. The
lute is highly polished and studded with small
colored crystals. A leather carrying case is
behind the lute [6 gp], together with five notebooks
[2 gp each] containing details and lyrics of
various lachrymose dirges. [1,006 gp total]
91 The chest is heavy white oak reinforced with
black wrought iron [44 gp]. The latch is closed
and held with a lock built into the chest.
[Average lock, DC 25]. Inside you find a pair of
riding saddles, dyed burgundy red [10 gp each],
and a sickle with a finely honed blade and
shaped wooden handle [for use as a weapon; 6
gp]. Below them are two saddle blankets [deep
red, 5 sp each] and one plain leather bridle with
a bit [2 gp]. At the bottom of the chest are a
horn, an openwork panel, a pouch and four
packages wrapped in leather. The short, fat horn
is brass and makes a nice sound when blown [5
gp]. The panel is like a picture frame, about two
hand spans high by one wide, with gold filigree
inside the thin gold frame [perhaps from a temple
window; 15 gp]. The pouch holds coins [79 gp,
174 sp, 604 cp], a bracelet of silver loops with
five pieces of turquoise [150 gp], five eye agates
and a moss agate [10 gp each]. The first three
wrapped packages each protect one tall silver
goblet with a stem [125 gp each]. Each vessel has
slightly different scenes of winemaking engraved
on it and in the central scene, five small green
gems [chrysoprase] depict the grapes. The fourth
bundle conceals a small gold statue of a squat
and ugly figure, grimacing and holding a bladed
weapon of obsidian [perhaps a goblin or evil deity;
220 gp]. [Total 1,000.44 gp]
92 In the center of the room sits a small chest with
the lid already open. You can see gold and silver
coins inside from where you stand. As you begin
to make your way toward the chest you notice
one wall has a faded fresco of a horrific battle
scene. [If the adventurers take the time to investigate,
they will discover:] In certain places, the
blood in the battle scene seems slightly emphasized,
almost as if it has a slight gleam to it.
[Further searching will reveal:] The fresco has
nearly a score of bloodstones imbedded into it,
mixed in with the painted blood. They do not
seem to form any sort of discernable pattern and
they look as if you could easily pluck them out
with the point of a dagger. [If the adventurers
decide to take the bloodstones:] After a few minutes
you have removed twenty bloodstones [30
gp each] from the wall. When you make your way
to the chest in the center of the room, you find
it does indeed hold a pile of silver and gold coins
[280 gp; 1,253 sp]. [Total 1,005.3 gp]
93 A latched oak and iron chest [50 gp] is carved
with dancing monkeys and chaotically flying
parrots, whose feathers and fur are highlighted
with inlaid soapstone and rock flecks. After
opening the chest, you discover a trio of colorful
wool scarves decorated with embroidered forest
scenes [5 gp each]. Wrapped in the red and white
the mother of all treasure tables
84
scarf, you find a cylindrical magnifying glass just
big enough to fit a man’s palm with its handle
decorated with painted peacock feathers [230
gp]. A coin-sized wooden box [3 sp] nearby contains
a set of replacement lenses for the glass [50
gp]. Under the scarves, you find a heavy floorlength
winter cloak with a deep hood sewn from
soft white pelts and decorated with bone fetishes,
which has a pale blue, floor length inner
cloak sewn to the underside [110 gp]. A smoked
glass jug with a fish-shaped handle holds potent
vodka [20 gp]. A net bag [1 sp] is filled with
white-gold coins, imprinted with leaping stags
[172 gp]. A small linen tube tied to the coin purse
holds six fine round pieces of malachite [30 gp
each]. Beneath the heavy cloak, you find an old
and tattered red cape [3 sp] wrapped around a
scimitar with a carved ivory hilt [55 gp]. The hilt
is longer than those of most swords, the ivory yellow-
white inscribed with strange hooked designs.
A piece of leather [caribou hide] is wrapped
around the lower part of the hilt to give a good
grip. A pair of snowshoes [45 gp], their ribs
carved [walrus] ivory lashed together with [caribou]
leather strips, rests beside the fur cloak,
along with two pairs of warm foot coverings
[stockings or boots] sewn together from rabbit pelts
[4 gp]. A polished ivory ring [82 gp] is stuffed into
one of the foot covers. [Total 1,013.7 gp]
94 Here you see a latched chest, a bucket and a
bow. A longbow of yew with a grip of pale calfskin
[75 gp] lies beside a quiver of deer hide
tooled all over with cleverly intertwined hunting
scenes [5 gp]. There are no arrows in the
quiver but it holds a silver flask etched with
flower decorations which is full of rich red wine
[flask 10 gp; wine 1 gp]. The chest [2 gp] contains
a light, leather riding saddle [10 gp], a square of
fine lace [5 gp] and a pair of white elbow-length
gloves sprinkled with freshwater pearls around
the top [pair 340 gp]. Beside them, wrapped in a
rag, is a stick of charcoal [1 cp]. A tall thin book
with poorly executed carving on its wooden
covers is half-full of amateur sketches of people
and animals, done in charcoal [5 sp]. Caught in
a seam at the bottom is a red-brown garnet [100
gp]. The heavy, solid brass bucket [2 gp] holds
two fine silver platters [30 gp each], a black stone
cat with yellow eyes [onyx with 2 small citrines;
250 gp], a hinged box with a tiny hunting scene
on the top in bright enamels [15 gp] and a heavy
coin pouch [1 gp]. The little box holds a fine
powder [one-half pound cinnamon, 5 sp; or a spell
component or other spice]. [In the coin pouch are 65
gp, 393 sp, 203 cp and 3 pieces of turquoise, 10 gp
each]. [Total 1,013.34 gp]
95 A coarse leather sack [2 gp] holds an oak-hafted
warhammer [12 gp], a sheepskin vest for a large
man [3 gp], a coil of hempen rope [50 feet, 1 gp]
and a sturdy clay pitcher, large enough to serve
beer to six persons, glazed dark brown with a
lighter brown ring as a design on the outside [2
sp]. Five shiny brass eating bowls [5 sp each] and
a yellow wool cloak lined in pale blue silk [37 gp]
are jumbled together beneath these. Below the
bowls, at the bottom of the sack, you find a
number of odd objects. One is the statue of a
stocky deity with a long beard, both hands raised
in an aggressive warding gesture. The statue is
too large for a halfling to hold in one hand and
is gold [150 gp]. A very heavy, nearly black rock
of about the same size is crudely carved with a
scowling face, making it resemble a gargoyle’s
face [marble, 2 gp]. A divided drawstring pouch
of fine calfskin holds, in separate chambers,
three identical pairs of well made bone dice.
[The two pairs on one side are honest and roll fairly.
The third, separate, pair is cleverly and invisibly
weighted and almost always rolls the same side up.
Pouch and dice set 5 gp] You also find a broad gold
bracelet [450 gp] with eight red stones [carnelians]
and a massive silver and turquoise necklace
[necklace 300 gp]. At the bottom are scattered
a couple hundred coins [11 gp, 23 sp, 194
cp] and two small pieces of banded agate [10 gp
each]. [Total 999.94 gp]
96 A man’s tall hat of silver fox fur, fully two hand
spans high [35 gp] sits on the first of three barrels
[2 gp each]. Leaning against the barrel is a
longsword in a scabbard. The sword [100 gp] has
a cross hilt with a clear stone [rock crystal] in the
pommel. The scabbard [5 gp] and sword belt [2
gp] are heavily tooled dark leather and the belt
has a handsome bell-shaped pewter buckle [2
gp]. The first wooden barrel is filled with wheat
[whole grains, 100 pounds; 1 gp]. The other two
barrels are similar only they contain a golden ale
[4 gp each]. Behind the barrels, a wooden basket
[4 sp] holds two long wool skirts, green and gray
[2 gp each], six pairs of heavy, well made socks for
large feet [1 gp per pair] and a leather wallet [1
gp]. In the leather wallet you find three quills for
writing [2 cp each], a vial of ink [8 gp], eight
sheets of fine stationery [5 sp each], and, at the
bottom, a thin, fine stiletto [100 gp] with three
tiny green spinels along its hilt. A secret fold in
the wallet reveals a stickpin [510 gp], probably a
man’s ornament, with a large clear yellow gem
[topaz] on its head. A loosely woven sack [1 sp]
set beside the basket contains six clay cups with
handles [1 sp each], painted with bright figures of
dancers and wrapped in rags. A leather pouch [1
gp] underneath the cups holds coins [6 pp, 39 gp,
table V: 1,000 gold pieces
85
67 sp, 384 cp], two freshwater pearls [10 gp each]
and a delicate silver ring with a trio of rose
quartz [80 gp]. [Total 1,003.70 gp]
97 A wooden shelf is fixed to the wall about head
height and a small shrine is set up on it. The
centerpiece is a gold statue of an unknown god
with seven arms and three heads which share
seven faces among them. The statue has small
garnets for eyes and crystal shards for the swords
and daggers wielded by the god [800 gp]. In front
of the statue are three golden cups [25 gp each],
smaller than a tea cup in size, each of which
holds seven sticks of incense which have long
since burned themselves out. To one side is a silver
bowl [15 gp] and drinking cup [10 gp] with
some fragments of long-decayed vegetable matter,
as well as a pile of unused [and slightly old]
incense sticks [343 sticks, 1 cp each]. To the other
side is a small ceramic pot with artificial plants,
made from cloth, on which some powdered gold
has been scattered [5 gp] and a life-size bust of
some unknown person [a famous holy man,
woman or monk, executed skillfully in low grade
marble; 100 gp]. [Total 1,008.43 gp]
98 A set of half-plate armor [600 gp] lies here, neatly
laid out, with the skeleton of its owner still
inside. It looks almost as if he just laid down to
rest (in armor) and died. In the right hand of the
skeletal sleeper is an unusual, two-bladed sword
[100 gp] still in battle-ready condition. Lying at
its feet is a heavy steel shield covered in dust,
like the rest of the items you have examined
thus far. When you wipe the dust away from the
shield you can see it is expertly forged and looks
much as it did when it was first created [masterwork;
170 gp]. Finally, still intact under the
shield is a pair of hard leather boots, occupied by
the bony feet of the skeleton. These boots are
also skillfully crafted and look as if they would
be exceedingly comfortable [masterwork; 105
gp]. [Under the armor, the skeleton wears a gold ring
on his right hand, with the head of a dragon engraved
on it; 25 gp.] [Total 1,000 gp]
99 On the floor is a strange bright green box roughly
the size of two small dogs standing side by side
[4 gp]. Upon closer examination, you see the box
is made of wood, plated with sheets of copper,
which have oxidized to a striking green color.
The lid of the box has no hinges, and it lifts off
with a sharp squeak. Inside, the wood has
swelled slightly and smells of damp; a moldering
cloth covers the box’s contents. Moving the
cloth aside, you see the box is full to the brim
with coins from several nations [632 gp, 1,020
sp, 900 cp]. Mixed in with the coins are a number
of other items: an ivory swan the size of a
gnome’s hand, which is missing the tip of one of
its wings [70 gp]; a glass perfume vial the size of
an elf’s finger, which smells strongly of
hyacinths [20 gp]; a pale wooden mask, sized for
a human and carved to look like a medusa’s head
[27 gp]; and a slim wooden case [16 gp]. Inside
the case, closed with a delicate silver hasp, is an
ivory scepter as long as a man’s forearm [122 gp].
The scepter has a tooled leather grip on one end
while the other is shaped like a dragon’s skull
complete with ivory teeth. One of the dragon’s
eye sockets is empty, but the other holds a chunk
of bloodstone. [Total 1,002 gp]
100 You open a chest, which holds a longbow [75 gp]
lying diagonally across everything else. A
ground quiver [which stands by the archer’s foot; 3
gp] holding 55 arrows [5 cp each] is laid next to
it. Crosswise and just below the bow is an oddshaped
leather case closed with a buckle [4 gp].
Inside is a small harp, the size a wandering minstrel
carries. It has graceful designs on the body
in inlaid wood and when strummed, the tone is
lovely [masterwork, 100 gp]. Most of the rest of
the space in the trunk is packed with blankets,
towels and table linens: ten lightweight gray
blankets [2 sp each], 25 towels rolled tightly [3 cp
each], and three linen tablecloths [24 gp each],
each with twelve matching napkins [5 sp each],
one set woven in blues, one in greens, and one
in shades of gold. Lodged in a far corner on the
right side of the chest is a blue glass duck, its
slender neck and reaching beak almost as tall as
the chest is deep. The quality and smoothness of
the glass is amazing; it must be a masterwork [55
gp]. In the left corner of the chest stands a tall
silver vase, wide enough at the top to put your
hand into it [70 gp]. [Nothing can be seen inside
the vase because it narrows before bulging out at the
base. However, it rattles if it is moved.] Inside the
vase are a matched pair of brooches, each with
four blue-white moonstones set in an oval of
gold [set 520 gp]. A brown leather pouch [1 gp]
tucked into the middle of a stack of napkins
holds coins [39 gp, 112 sp, 90 cp] and four pretty
moss agates [10 gp each]. [Total 1,002.6 gp]

Most of this stuff I can use, but
some of it is just strange!
All sets are valued at 5,000 gold pieces plus or minus
2%, or in other words 4,900 to 5,100 gp. The italicized
text contains values and information reserved for the game
master. In general, the GM will not immediately read this
text to the players; it is there for the GM to use as he or
she sees fit.
Roll d% and use the indicated set:
01 The pile of armor on the floor looks far too large
to be a single suit of plate. The pieces are too big
to fit a human, even a very tall human. Even if
they were sized for a human, they are oddly
shaped. It is not until you get a little closer that
you realize these are pieces of barding, too small
for a warhorse, but definitely shaped for a horse
[warpony plate barding, 3,000 gp]. Sticking out
from the bottom of the barding pile is a lance,
still in good repair, but smaller than other lances
you have seen [small lance, 10 gp]. Under the
barding is a fine saddle sized for a small
humanoid rider [small military saddle, 20 gp]. A
pair of small saddlebags [2 gp each], side pockets
bulging, rests on top of the saddle. Opening the
first clasp causes a few coins to spurt out of the
top like a fountain; this pocket is overstuffed
with gold and silver, as is the second pocket on
this side [461 gp, 513 sp]. On the other side, the
pockets are a little less full, but still packed. A
small twist of paper holds six transparent red
gems [6 carnelian, 80 gp each]. A similar packet
carries nine small green stones [9 peridot, 70 gp
each]. These rest amid a collection of trail
rations which have turned moldy from age and
damp [worthless]. The final pocket contains a
wooden case [1 gp] which holds a set of 12 darts
[all masterwork, 90 gp set] and four vials of antitoxin
[50 gp each]. [Total 4,947.3 gp]
02 Upon a waist-high column of green marble
[weight 150 pounds; 75 gp] stands a statuette of
carved ivory upon an ebony wood base. The
statuette depicts a nude female fairy dancing
gracefully with wings fashioned from a mosaic of
gleaming mother of pearl [155 gp]. Next to the
column is a table whose legs are carved white
marble depicting griffons, with two griffons back
to back supporting one side [two legs] of the
table. The table surface is highly polished rosewood
and the table can be disassembled into
three component parts [the legs of one side, 175
gp; the legs of the other side, 175 gp; and the table
surface, 25 gp]. A cherry wood box rests on the
table [8 gp]. Within the box is a silver dragon
comb with a tiny red eye [silver comb with ruby
chip for an eye, 256 gp] resting upon fine black
silk [10 gp]. The silk itself is wrapped around a
pair of silver candlesticks as thick as a man’s fist
and long as his forearm. They are shaped like
winged dragons whose heads are bowed and
wings folded at their sides. The dragons’ eyes are
small gleaming red faceted gems [rubies] and the
candles would be supported upon their heads
while they silently stand watch [728 gp each].
[Search, DC 12 to find a hidden compartment
beneath the candlesticks.] Beneath the candlesticks
and the silk is a hidden compartment.
Beneath the lid the compartment is lined with
black wool and holds a very large red stone
about the size of a man’s thumb pad, with a starshaped
accent [star ruby; 2,250 gp] and a beautiful
blue stone that glistens in the light [aquamarine,
425 gp]. [Total 5,010 gp]
03 The contents of this area are unusual, to say the
least. A dead apple tree sits in the center of the
room in a large wooden basin of dirt. The tree is
not full grown, being only about eight feet tall.
There is no sign of fruit or leaves, which indicates
the tree has been dead for some time.
Around the dead tree are four other basins filled
with dirt, but with no plants in them. You
approach the first basin and notice the dirt is
loosely placed in the container, so it would be
easy to dig up. [If the adventurers decide to dig up
the dirt in the basins:] You start to remove dirt
from the first container and something golden
catches your eye. You pull out an oversized apple
seed made of gold. The replica is beautifully
crafted and heavy — it must weigh nearly a
pound. [There are ten seeds to find in this basin; 50
gp each.] After making sure nothing else hides in
the first basin you move on to the next and
begin to dig. Within seconds you unearth a large
golden apple leaf, and then another. There are
ten, each leaf identical to the next and weighing
about 2 pounds [100 gp each]. You eagerly make
your way to the next container and begin to
remove the dirt. It does not take long for you to
uncover ten golden apples. Like the golden
leaves, each apple looks exactly alike, and they
appear to be made of solid gold, weighing about
Table VI:
5,000 Gold Pieces
87
4 pounds each [10 apples, 200 gp each]. Finally
you approach the last basin and begin to dig.
You discover another ten golden apples, but
these are different from the ones you found in
the previous basin. Each of these apple replicas
is a representation of an apple which has been
partially eaten, and no two are identical. Each
has a large bite taken out of it, or two or three
smaller ones. Although odd, they are crafted just
as impressively as the rest of the treasures you
have found here, and each one weighs about 3
pounds [10 half-eaten apples, 150 gp each].
[Nothing special is buried in the container with the
dead tree. 5 basins, 1 gp each] [Total 5,005 gp]
04 A large heavy oak chest [5 gp] contains a horncovered
lantern wrought of iron, with a well
made curving iron handle [10 gp], an openweave
bag [2 sp], a pair of knee-high, black and
white plaid thick woolen stockings [like socks,
but the foot is not well defined so anyone could wear
them; 5 gp] and an iron frying pan [5 sp]. A
hinged square of wood opens to show a crudely
painted but brightly colored portrait of a young,
brown-haired woman holding a baby [5 cp]. A
sleek mahogany box has a green velvet lining
and holds a set of 12 forks and 12 spoons made
of gold, the handles all decorated with different
miniature scenes [box 5 gp; fork or spoon 20 gp
each]. Another fine mahogany box, this one
lined in dark blue, holds a necklace of clear crystals
dangling like a string of icicles [rock crystal;
necklace 1,800 gp]. Under them are several folded
garments for religious ceremonies [vestments]
of deepest blue silk carefully embroidered with
holy symbols and other religious images in silver
and gold thread [15 human-sized robes, 70 gp
each; sun or sea god/goddess]. A heavy repeating
crossbow [400 gp] is jammed at the back of chest
next to a pair of large daggers set with green
stones [green spinel; set of daggers 220 gp]. A dog,
too big to hold in one hand, carved of pale yellow
jade is tucked in one corner of the chest
[700 gp] and a sack of coins and gems is in the
opposite corner [57 gp, 195 sp, 941 cp; 2
turquoise, 10 gp each; 4 peridots, 50 gp each; 4
hematite, 10 gp each] [Total 5,021.66 gp]
05 The heap of scraps and trash [or: rotting leaves
and vegetable matter] looks uninteresting.
Reluctantly poking through it with one foot, it
soon becomes clear that there are more interesting
items hidden among the dross. First, you
come across a small, battered, iron box [8 gp]
which contains three leather bags [4 sp each].
The first is stuffed with a large number of platinum
pieces [151 pp]. The second holds a linen
banner folded and bound very tightly which, if
unfurled, reveals a gorgeous gold-threaded
embroidery of a phoenix rising above a twoheaded
lion, suitable for mounting on a lance
[750 gp]. The third has two matching sets of finger
cymbals made from silver and electrum, with
blue silk tassels and cords. When tapped together,
the cymbals make a delightfully musical
clashing sound [finger cymbals, 112 gp total].
Exploring further in the pile, you also come
across a broad, flat canvas bag [3 sp] with some
lightweight but well protected items inside.
Opening the bag, you find an oilskin-wrapped
bundle [oilskin, 6 sp] which hides a sheaf of paintings
and charcoal sketches in the form of a portfolio.
The sketches are excellent in quality and
seven in number featuring a nude or partially
undressed female, possibly elven, reclining gracefully
in a variety of settings [7 sketches, 100 gp
each]. The five oil paintings vary slightly in size
and quality, but some are absolutely striking.
Each has a title scribed on its reverse side. They
include a still life of rabbits prepared for the stewpot,
together with vegetables and a flagon of ale
[painting titled ‘Still Life on a Shingle’; 250 gp], a
landscape of mountains with a red dragon swooping
menacingly overhead [painting titled ‘The
Flight of Fire Lizard’; 475 gp], a set of three small,
flaxen-haired and nauseatingly cherubic children
[painting titled ‘Halflings on a Half-Shell’; 80 gp], a
fight between four orcs and a drunken halfling
[painting titled ‘Pick on Somebody Your Own Size’;
350 gp] and, finally, a shallow boat floating unattended
towards a precipitous waterfall, with a
warrior’s body laid out in it as if on a bier. The
detail is so amazing, you can practically feel the
spray from the waterfall [painting titled ‘The
Funeral of the Chief’; 750 gp]. [Total 4,987.1 gp]
06 At first this room looks empty, but it seems the
walls are shining. Upon closer inspection you
see the walls are sheathed in thin gold plates.
The plates are square, a little more than a pace
in each direction, and they are fitted together
almost seamlessly. The floor is not similarly plated,
but the ceiling is, with a swirling pattern
stamped into the plates. [If the characters decide to
strip the gold off the walls they will find about 50
golden panels, each worth 100 gp. They are difficult
to handle because they are so bulky. Being thin, they
are almost impossible to remove from the walls without
bending them so they no longer lay flat.] [Total
5,000 gp]
07 This seems like a weapons room. On one side
twenty spears [2 gp each] and a dozen halberds
[10 gp each] lean against the wall. Beyond them
stand ten greatswords [8 plain greatswords, 50 gp
each]. One of the greatswords has a black jewel in
the mother of all treasure tables
88
the pommel [onyx; greatsword 150 gp] and another
has a yellow-green gem [chrysoberyl; greatsword
250 gp]. Next are other swords: longswords [25
total; 22 plain longswords, 15 gp each], rapiers [15
total; 13 plain rapiers, 20 gp each], and six scimitars
[5 plain scimitars, 15 gp each]. Most are plain,
but two longswords have gems in their pommels
[rose quartz longsword, 65 gp; green spinel
longsword, 115 gp] and one has three small rock
crystals around a big piece of rose quartz
[longsword, 160 gp]. One rapier has a fine purple
stone [amethyst; rapier, 120 gp] and another has
gold wire around the grip and a thumb-sized
tourmaline [rapier, 230 gp]. One scimitar has a
patterned blade and small dark gems along the
hilt [hematite; scimitar 65 gp]. Crossbows hang
from hooks: two dozen heavy [50 gp each], a
dozen light [30 gp each], and one heavy, repeating
crossbow [400 gp]. Several are distinguished
by painted colors. Bolts for the crossbows are
arrayed in a set of cubbyholes: there are twelve
sets of 20 normal bolts [1 sp each] and four sets of
20 for the repeating crossbow [2 sp each]. In other
niches are ten grappling hooks [1 gp each] and
lengths of cheap rope [10, 50 foot rolls; 1 gp each].
Six portable battering rams with heads consisting
of rams, fists, or dogs lean against the wall
[12 gp each]. Bags of black iron caltrops are
stacked in the corner [50 bags at 1 gp each]. A
locked ironbound strongbox [Good lock; box 90
gp] holds coins and gems [300 gp, 500 sp; 10 blue
quartz, 10 gp each]. [Total 5,062 gp]
08 You find a box which is an armspan wide and
long, made from solid oak and lacquered to a
deep cherry red. Its top surface is full of tiny
levers and circular patterns while its sides are
covered in archaic writing. [Astute characters
might determine these levers and circular patterns
must be manipulated and aligned to open the box
successfully; assign a very hard task check to this.
As a curio the box might fetch 1,000 gp due to the
mechanism inside. The writing can be in any language
but is non-magical; it can also be a clue or just
the scribbles of a deranged mind. When the box is
opened:] You hear a sudden click as the last lever
rotates an odd circle to align with the others.
The lid suddenly rises with a whirr and whisper
of a mechanism and there is a grinding sound
akin to that of gears which fills the air. You
experience a rush of tension, but no sudden
death is unleashed from inside the box, and the
sound stills as quickly as it has begun. The lid
has risen upwards and is now supported upon
two slender metal arms. Each arm has a myriad
of tiny gears and workings attached to it and
through a clear glass aperture you can see the
inner machinery of the box’s workings. Below
the machinery inside the box is the glitter and
gleam of coinage, a treasure trove of various
denominations and types [161 pp, 2,024 gp,
3,117 sp, 10,467 cp]. [Total 5,050.37 gp]
09 The room is nicely appointed with a divan and
a pair of chairs all covered in dark blue satin
[divan, 150 gp; 2 chairs, 75 gp each]. All three
pieces are trimmed in rich, dark wood polished
to a high gloss. They look [and are] quite comfortable.
To one side of each chair is a wooden
table [2 tables, 40 gp each] made of the same
wood as the frame of the chairs and divan. Both
tables have a small drawer with a crystal knob.
A table made of the same wood, longer and
lower, rests in front of the divan [table, 60 gp].
Resting on the low table is a large glass box with
a wood frame and a glass cover [glass box, 107
gp]. It appears to have been set up to house a
snake or reptile. There is a large chunk of purplish
rock in the center [raw amethyst, 350 gp].
The bottom of the tank is covered with small
irregular silver and blue stones [157 hematites, 5
gp each; 166 lapis lazuli, 5 gp each]. On one of the
smaller tables, there is a large golden bowl nearly
a foot in diameter. It is decorated with basrelief
fruit [golden bowl, 90 gp]. Resting inside is
a small mass of platinum and gold coins [38 pp,
232 gp]. The other table holds a fanciful goblet
made of gold and studded with four deep violet
stones [violet garnet goblet 1,700 gp]. [Anyone who
thinks to rummage through the cushions of the divan
and chairs finds an additional 4 gp, 7 sp, 3 cp].
[Total 4,918.73 gp]
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
10 There is a small locked door to one side [Good
lock; alternatively, this treasure could be buried in a
safe place] and, once opened it reveals a small
room, several paces along each side and just tall
enough for a short man to stand erect. Peering
into the room reveals an astonishing sight;
wooden carvings are everywhere, piled on
shelves, stacked along each wall, filling baskets
and spilling over onto the floor. Nearest to you
are several carved boats, each a foot long and
with minute but effective variations, as if carved
from memories of real life [17 boats; 20 gp each].
The boats are just a foretaste of the sculptor’s
real vocation, for there are literally hundreds of
wooden frogs, carved from what seem to be
identical blocks of some common wood. The
frogs are all depicted crouching, with mouths
open. Holes have been bored through their
haunches, in each of which a small wooden rod
rests. There are also notches on the backs of the
frogs. [Pull out the rod and rub it up and down the
frog’s back to obtain a froglike ‘ribbit, ribbit’ noise.]
This plague of wooden frogs numbers in the
thousands, piled high and overflowing numerous
reed baskets. [13 baskets, 2 sp each; 2,330 frogs;
Each frog is worth 2 gp but it will take some effort to
trail around to markets and merchants to be able to
sell them all.] [Total 5,002.6 gp]
11 You enter the room and are instantly amazed by
what you see. Hanging from the ceiling is a
mobile depicting the planets and moons arcing
through space. You cannot be sure if it is an
actual depiction of the heavenly bodies which
share the space of the planet you occupy, but it
is an impressive mobile nonetheless. There are
six planets, five moons, and the sun in the center.
The planets appear to be made of etched silver,
the moons are made of etched ivory, and the
sun is made of gold. [The planets are worth 350 gp
each, the moons are worth 125 gp each, and the sun
is worth 2,150 gp.] Each is supported by a strong
silk cord which will have to be detached [silk
cord, 12 pieces of 5 feet each, 5 sp each]. [Total
4,881 gp]
12 You find a broken crate with pieces of wood
scattered inside and out. Within the crate are
two statues of different animals made entirely
from gold and set with precious gems for eyes.
The first statue is a golden dog [2,500 gp] which
stands half as high as a man’s knee; its eyes are
made from a luminous green gemstone [jade] and
its jaws are open as if in a snarl. It has small
painted claws and stands on a wooden base [5
gp], which is made from a hard red polished
wood. To the base is attached a small metal
plaque inscribed with the name ‘Felostan’. [This
was the name of a favored pet or familiar; this statue
was cast in its likeness for the original owner.]
The second statue is of a golden hawk [2,500 gp]
slightly shorter than the dog. The hawk’s eyes
are made from a slightly darker green gemstone
[jade] and its talons are painted jet black. Each
and every feather has been painstakingly carved
from the gleaming golden material and shines
and shimmers beautifully. It is set upon a dark
wood base [5 gp] formed into a wooden perch, to
which the bird is carefully attached. The base
has a small metal plaque inscribed with the
name ‘Garamond’. [The history of this piece is the
same as that of the dog statue; the two were made
for a husband and wife who were both wizards.]
[Total 5,010 gp]
13 You find a large wooden box, about six feet long
and wider at the top than at the bottom, made
of a grayish-white wood [driftwood; box 55 gp].
The shape reminds you of a coffin, though it
seems rather narrow. The edges of the top are
carved with the shapes of various seashells, and
long strands of wooden seaweed drift along the
sides. [If the adventurers try to move the box they
discover it is very heavy — more than 900 pounds.]
The lid of the box opens easily, and inside a
magnificent trident floats atop a sea of silver
[masterwork trident; 315 gp]. The box seems to
hold nothing else but thousands upon thousands
of silver coins [46,000 sp]. [Total 4,970 gp]
14 A large ironbound box [2 gp] sits along the wall
[in the corner, etc.]. Inside you find a coil of
embroidered green silk ribbon, as wide as your
hand and very long. On it are complex flowers
in red, white and yellow done in amazingly tiny
stitches [30 yards; 1 gp per yard]. A square metal
tin with a painting of a domestic scene on the
lid [tin, 5 sp] contains dozens of small rounded
pieces of sugar, flavored with fruit [candies, 5 gp].
A small sack [1 sp] holds jewelry: a narrow silver
armband, a gaudy ring, a pair of gold loop earrings,
and a tiny-jeweled box. The armband
looks like a silver snake with a complex braided
pattern along its length and a snake’s head on
one end [30 gp]. It is long enough to go twice
around most wearers’ upper arm. The ring is gold
but the gold is nearly masked by gems, ten of
them, all different, going all around the ring
[moss agate, turquoise, lapis lazuli, malachite, rose
quartz, clear quartz, jasper, crysoprase, citrine and
iolite; gaudy ring 400 gp]. The earrings are huge
gold loops long enough to brush the shoulder
when worn [pair 30 gp]. The box is gold set with
small violet gems [6 amethysts, 2 small violet garnets].
It has a miniature lock which is very well
made [Good lock; box 1,500 gp]. Inside, on green
89
the mother of all treasure tables
90
velvet, is a heart-shaped brooch of platinum set
with three tiny emeralds [brooch 2,500 gp]. At
the bottom of the ironbound box you find a
heavy silvery bar [platinum ingot 500 gp]. [Total
4,997.60 gp]
15 You find a well made wagon [35 gp] with sixteen
crates in the back. Each crate is stamped on the
side with a bottle and a sprig of grapes [2 gp
each]. Opening one of the crates reveals a bottle
of foreign wine, packed lovingly with straw to
prevent breakage. [Each crate holds eight bottles of
imported wine, 128 bottles total; 10 gp
each]. Behind the stacks of crates are two suits of
half-plate armor [800 gp each], two dented light
steel shields [9 gp each], and two identically
made longswords [masterwork longswords, 315 gp
each]. Each sword has the engraving “For my
sons” along the blade. On one sword the pommel
has the initials ‘HK’ engraved, and on the
other ‘TK’; both seem to have been made by a
master smith, and have been well looked after.
On the driver’s seat of the wagon rests a
heavy repeating crossbow [400 gp], its bolts completely
depleted. On the floorboards is a silver
hip flask inlaid with gold vines wrapping around
it [30 gp]. Next to it is a sturdy chest with a lock
[Average lock; chest 43 gp]. Inside the chest is a
collection of coinage and gems [15 pp, 350 gp,
600 sp, 300 cp; 3 freshwater pearls, 15 gp each; 1
violet garnet, 300 gp]. [Total 4,976 gp]
16 There is a fine mahogany box about the size of a
large pot with silver fastenings [30 gp]. Inside, a
silver chain and circlet lie on a bed of gold and
platinum coins. The circlet is decorated with
gold wire intertwined in a flowing pattern and
emphasizing the four blue and three lavender
stones decorating it [blue quartz and amethyst; circlet,
475 gp]. The silver chain supports a dangling
centerpiece of seven silver circles of various
sizes. The two smallest circles attach to the
chain, and are set at either end of a row of slightly
larger silver circles, each with a stone in the
center — one black, one blue and one purple.
Below those are two larger silver circles, one
holding a nearly flat piece of green stone, the
other a dark grey oval stone [onyx, blue quartz,
amethyst, green turquoise and hematite; necklace,
350 gp]. You also see a pouch, which proves to
contain more than a dozen beautiful stones.
There is one deep purple stone [alexandrite, 480
gp], a very fine sparkling blue gem [sapphire,
1,200 gp], five pieces of clear, pale green
[chrysoberyl, 120 gp each], and six pieces of
gleaming black [onyx; 70 gp each]. In the bottom
are a couple hundred coins [130 pp, 145 gp].
[Total 5,000 gp]
17 [If the adventurers are alert, they may notice a common
nest (of a rat, mouse, squirrel, chipmunk,
magpie, jay or other creature) holding a few shiny
objects of interest.] You see a nest made of twigs,
string, and other items the creatures have foraged.
Something shiny in the nest catches your
eye. Picking through the debris you find a shiny
steel key, which someone no doubt misses [4 cp].
You also spot something gold, and pull out two
gold coins [2 gp]. Something red gleams down
among the mess and you manage to hook your
finger around it. You retrieve a dirt-encrusted
bracelet, set with some type of red stones.
Wiping it off, you can see it is made of eight
platinum links, each set with a rounded, fiery
red-orange gem [platinum bracelet with eight small
fire opals, 4,924 gp]. [Total 4,926.04 gp]
18 Standing at the side of the room is a house; but
a house on a very small scale, not two paces high
and four long [dollhouse, 5,000 gp]. You find it is
the very model of some wealthy lord’s house.
Leaning against the house to get a better look,
the roof shakes beneath you and you realize it is
designed to be pulled back to reveal what is
inside. Walking around it, you discover the back
wall is missing completely, for presumably the
same reason. The top stories contain bedrooms
and private chambers, where tiny doll servants
attend their master and mistresses, clean and
change bed sheets, pour night dirt from chamber
pots out of the windows and rearrange cast off
clothing and shoes. One gallant soldier, his uniform
awry, is hiding in his lady’s cabinet, as if
fearful of discovery. It seems he need not worry
for the lord’s bed is full of plump-cheeked
wenches. Downstairs, the last few revelers are
being helped out of the ballroom, while a breakfast
buffet is being laid out on long tables in a
feasting hall. A small library holds several
shelves of tiny, seemingly unread scrolls and
books. [At the GM’s discretion, several of these
miniature scrolls and books could be removable,
containing spells or secret information.]. In the
kitchen, flames break out as fat pork is being
added to a giant frying pan. The whole effect is
quite exquisite and lifelike. [Total 5,000 gp]
19 You have discovered a gigantic urn, as tall as a
man’s shoulder [250 gp]. It is made of delicate
white porcelain and painted with designs —
swirls, spirals, and geometric shapes all the way
around. Painted near the rim of the urn is a
series of figures: men clad in loincloths and
brandishing spears. This pattern continues all
the way around the top of the urn. Two gilded
handles stick out just below the narrow neck
like large, misshapen ears. Looking into the top
of the urn reveals it is full, up past the top of the
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
91
neck, with copper coins [11,873 cp]. [If the characters
remove the copper:] With the copper
removed, you can see further into the urn. Well
below the narrowest point in the neck, there is
a blanket [5 sp] folded up across the entire
width. It takes a little doing to reach in and grab
it, but once you have hold of the blanket, you
are able to pull it out through the neck. Now,
when you shine a light into the urn, you can see
the glint of gold! [It is difficult to get anything out
of the urn; the neck is too narrow to reach in easily,
and the urn is fragile and likely to break if handled
roughly. If the characters manage it (or simply
smash the urn), they find:] A stream of gold coins
pours out of the urn [3,673 gp], finally trickling
off. Mixed with the gold you find a long, well
made wooden box [2 gp] with a spyglass [1,000
gp] held in padded forms inside it, and a narrow
brass casket [5 gp] which proves to hold a silver
medallion [holy symbol to a sun god, 25 gp], and a
slender gold bracelet with a clasp [25 gp]. [Total
5,099.23 gp]
20 You find three ironbound oak barrels [2 gp each]
which seem to be full of wheat when you examine
them [2 barrels wheat, 55 pounds per barrel;
55 cp each]. The barrel at the back has a fingerdeep
layer of wheat on top. Under it, however,
you discover five layers of tightly woven white
linen cloth the size of a blanket [5 pieces of linen,
4 square yards each; 16 gp per piece] above twenty
neatly packed silver dinner plates [5 gp each].
Below the plates you find gold teacups without
handles, 40 of them [20 gp each]. Under the layers
of cups are several more pieces of linen [4
pieces of linen, 4 square yards each; 16 gp per piece]
protecting two massive, round, gold serving
plates, each almost as wide as the barrel, with
delicate gold tracery on the borders [2 gold plates,
500 gp each]. Stacked below them are jeweled
eating knives, each with a pink and white quartz
crystal in the pommel [star rose quartz; 25 knives,
52 gp each]. A layer of napkins comes next, a
dozen each in red, black, white and purple silk.
Each is embroidered with climbing vines of the
same color as the napkin; flowers on the vines
and small birds are done in gold thread [48 napkins,
30 gp each]. The bottom of the barrel contains
a small leather-bound book [book of etiquette;
10 gp], a piece of paper with a menu elaborately
printed in gold ink [5 cp], and eight
round metal cylinders as long as your finger with
tight-fitting caps. Inside the cylinders are carved
wooden toothpicks [8 silver cylinders, 5 gp each;
200 toothpicks per cylinder, 1 gp per set]. The last
thing in the barrel is a deep layer of coins across
the bottom [87 gp, 802 sp, 1,121 cp]. [Total
5,027.56 gp]
21 A chest [5 gp] holds a square box of polished
dark wood, on which the top is decorated with
alternating squares of dark and light brown
stone [agates; box 1,010 gp]. The box is not very
deep and the checkered board lifts off to reveal
40 small discs, 20 of dark brown agate and 20 of
light [40 agate discs; 10 gp each]. Lying under the
box and folded carefully inside a piece of plain
linen is a length of fine deep purple silk embroidered
with dozens of tiny pearls [linen, 1 square
yard, 4 gp; silk, 10 square yards, embroidered with
240 pearls; 2,600 gp]. A leather shoulder bag [10
gp] holds a silvered vial filled with a clear liquid
[holy water, 25 gp; vial, 2 sp], six small candles [1
cp each] and a dozen sticks of incense [sandalwood;
1 gp each]. A pouch holds hundreds of
coins [160 gp, 810 sp, 97 cp], several pieces of
blue quartz [16 pieces; 10 gp each] and a square of
metal, ‘T’-shaped in side view. On the broad top
of the ‘T’, a design is inscribed. [This silver stamp
puts the design, or maker’s mark, into whatever it is
the artisan makes; 5 gp.] A greatsword in an ivory
sheath lies diagonally across the bottom of the
chest. Its hilt has the form of a raging golden
dragon, with red eyes [red spinels]. The sheath is
also carved with dragons [greatsword, 300 gp;
sheath, 250 gp]. [Total 5,023.23 gp]
22 A cedar chest with a lid bearing a carving of a
swan sits here [35 gp], closed with a silver padlock
[Simple lock, 20 gp]. Inside the chest are several
items of clothing. It includes a tunic made
of beautiful royal blue fabric, bearing a collar
and cuffs of ermine and glittering with buttons
set with gems; and a pair of tight black breeches
[royal outfit; 200 gp]. Next are finely made riding
boots of excellent craftsmanship [10 gp pair].
Beneath these is a fine blue wool cloak trimmed
in silver fox and lined with wolf fur [75 gp]. The
cloak partially covers a small bag of coin [36 pp,
48 gp, 56 sp], yards of fine red silk [6 square yards,
60 gp], and a smaller wooden box made of
gleaming cherry wood [7 gp]. This box is lined
with red velvet and contains a golden choker
collar set with a sparkling blue sapphire [1,200
gp], and two very fine gold filigree chain ankle
bracelets set with tiny stones of deepest blue
[anklets with deep blue spinel stones; 650 gp each].
The box also holds two feminine-looking gold
bracelets of a heavier chain than the anklets and
glittering with matching tiny stones of blue
[bracelets with deep blue spinels, 850 gp each].
[Total 4,696.6 gp]
23 A large sheet of oil-cloth [40 gp] hides something
bulky and lumpy underneath. Pulling it
back reveals a wooden wagon [30 gp], with two
wheels intact and traces to hold a horse or perthe
mother of all treasure tables
92
haps a donkey. The wagon bed holds a variety of
bundles and packages. On top of the pile are two
dozen bags of sugar and one dozen bags of sea
salt [1 pound each, 5 gp each]. Each of these is
sealed with greaseproof paper. Removing these
reveals another layer of greaseproof-wrapped
bags of dried ginger powder, again 12 in all [1
pound each; 2 gp each]. Beneath these are four
sheaves of some type of straggly, dried plant
material [edible seaweed, 4 batches; 3 sp per batch]
and a large pot of pickled, salted land crabs
[about 40 pickled crabs, 3 sp each]. The next layer
down in the wagon is composed of wooden
boxes containing intricate children’s wooden
puzzles and toys — hours of fun to be had [24
toys in boxes, 6 gp each]! However, these small
value items pale in significance when compared
with what lies below them, three fine masterwork
composite longbows [+3 strength bonus,
700 gp each] made from the very best wood, horn
and fish oil glue, together with 21 quivers each
of 20 masterwork arrows [121 gp each] — a prize
indeed [This wagon was stolen from a merchant or
peddler. The goods may yet need to be fenced or they
may be of no value to the captor, depending on the
circumstances.] [Total 5,072.2 gp]
24 There is a colorful, bushy tree about the height
of two men growing in a large pot [or in the earth
or any suitable location; if a live tree would be out
of place, the leaves would be artificial]. At first, the
color seems to be derived from the leaves and
possibly some blooms but, as you come a little
closer, you realize numerous sparkly baubles
have been used to decorate the tree, perhaps in
response to some kind of festival or ritual. [Each
item is attached carefully but not too tightly to the
tree with fine cotton twine.] At eye level, you find
four golden icons of some kind of cat god with
one paw uplifted as if gesturing [150 gp each], as
well as six silver models of ladies’ slippers [6 pair,
50 gp each]. Bending down, you also find three
crystal birds with tiny peridot eyes; they might
be swallows or some similar type of bird [90 gp
each]. Lifting your eyes, you see a veritable
swarm of butterflies in the upper branches of the
tree, approximately life-size, and all very exquisite
items of silk and carnelian [100 butterflies;
15 gp each]. Also towards the top are nine bronze
warriors with very lifelike features and most
martial in aspect [10 gp each] and, sitting on the
very top of the tree, is a shining star [almost a
thumb joint long in diameter] which turns out to be
a large clear crystal at the center of a complex
silk, satin, and sparkling wool creation [rock
crystal 2,400 gp]. [Total 5,160 gp]
25 A small wooden cupboard is hung on a wall [2
gp]. It has a lock, but there is no key. [The lock is
old and fragile and if locked may easily be opened
with the blade of a knife or similar tool.] Inside are
three shelves of objects. The top shelf truly
‘catches the eye’, as it holds two rows of false
eyes made from milky glass, each with a different-
colored sliver of marble set into it for the
pupil, to give the impression of real eyes [20 false
eyes, 40 gp each]. The middle shelf contains a
foot-long, flat golden box [154 gp] which, when
drawn forth, is revealed to be inscribed with a
pattern depicting a starry night sky. Inside the
box is a set of five fine goose-quill pens [1 sp
each], together with a gold letter knife inlaid
with mother of pearl [52 gp]. Also on the second
shelf is a black velvet bag [3 gp] which contains
nine miniature statues of dragons made from a
silvery type of jade [330 gp each]. On the bottom
shelf of the cupboard is a dull, matte-black metal
tankard [tarnished pewter], which would hold
about half a pint, decorated with a very hard-tosee
engraving of a winged pig [10 gp]. Within the
tankard is a small linen bag [2 sp] containing
seven lozenges of pure platinum each about the
size of a coin [10 gp each] and a ruby-bedecked
silver locket with a few strands of golden hair
inside [locket with no chain; 1,030 gp]. Finally, at
the back of the cupboard in the bottom lefthand
corner is a scrap of parchment which bears
an inked message: “The eyes are not next to the
ears!” [Total 5,091.7 gp]
26 [If the adventurers are in a cavern:] You look up
and notice a very large stalactite, about thirty
feet up, with something hanging from it. [The
adventurers will need a good light source and a way
to get up to the stalactite before they can see more or
retrieve what is described] When you shine the
light on it you can tell a large bag has been tied
securely to the stalactite with rope.
[If the adventurers are in a room:] A heavy canvas
sack hangs from the ceiling, fastened to
some sort of hook or protruding stone.
[After the group devises a way to retrieve the
bag:] The sack is surprisingly heavy when you try
to bring it down to the ground. Untying the fastening
rope [hempen rope, 50 feet; 1 gp], you open
the bag in anticipation of what may be inside. In
the top is a climber’s kit, with all the items
someone would need to make climbing a wall or
solid rock much easier [80 gp]. Next you pull out
a coil of thin rope, silk woven with silver strands
[50 foot, 45 gp]. You reach in the bag again and
retrieve a chain shirt. The shirt is fashioned
from linked chains of silver and is exacting in its
detail and construction [masterwork chain shirt,
made of silver; 375gp]. You look back into the bag
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
93
and see the rest is a mass of gold coins, thousands
in fact. You sift through the coins to make
sure there is nothing else in the bag and indeed,
the coins are all that remain [4,421 gp]. [Total
4,920 gp]
27 Behind the [secret] door you find a treasure
trove. Four tall spears of nearly black wood with
long black stone heads lean against the wall
[teak longspears with obsidian heads; 150 gp each].
Beside them is a small round table — the legs of
several shades of wood, the surface a complex
inlay of colored stones and wood — depicting a
champion leading an army to victory over a
horde of goblins and trolls [inlaid table with
agates, quartz and other semiprecious pieces; 1,000
gp]. In a small box you find a necklace of heavy
copper, with ten thumbnail-sized blue-green
stones [turquoise; necklace 200 gp], a gold ring set
with four bright stones [green spinel, tourmaline,
coral and crysoberyl; ring 600 gp], a string of small
matched golden pearls [pearl necklace 1,200 gp]
and a sack of coins and gems [155 gp, 170 sp,
121 cp; 8 lapis lazuli, 4 hematite, 10 gp each]. In a
canvas shoulder bag [1 gp] marked with a religious
symbol [sign of the religion, ankh, cross, etc.]
you find six expensive beeswax candles [2 sp
each], 8 common candles [1 cp each], a handleless
gold candleholder [25 gp], a small silver vial
with a clear liquid [vial 5 gp, holy water 20 gp], a
well used scroll of daily prayers [2 gp] and a small
holy symbol of black and gold on a necklace of
black prayer beads [onyx and gold; holy symbol
230 gp, necklace 720 gp]. [Total 4,901.49 gp]
28 Things lie here and there in this area without any
sense of order. Stuck partially in a block of wood
[or in the ground] is a two-bladed sword. Without
rust or notch, it shines with reflected light [masterwork,
400 gp]. Nearby, an ornamental rapier
lies under scraps of soiled cloth. The handle is
inlaid with gold filigree, depicting an eagle with
spread wings. Again, the spotless blade tells of its
craftsmanship [masterwork, 345 gp].
A mass of gray cloth turns out to be a large
amount of silk which is still worth something,
though it is dirty in many places [23 yards; 7 gp
each]. Under the silk are three sets of breastplate
armor which need cleaning but seem to be of
good quality [masterwork, 350 gp each]. Three
crates standing off together are the only semblance
of order in this mess [2 gp each]. One has
its lid standing loose at its base and peering inside
you discover quite a wealth of ore. Two crates
hold gold ore [25 pounds each; 50 gp per pound]
and one crate holds silver ore [25 pounds; 5 gp per
pound]. Behind the crates you find a small bag [1
gp] partially hidden in the debris which holds
platinum coins [50 pp]. [Total 5,088 gp]
29 This room is lit by a beautiful chandelier made
of silver and colored crystals. Eight candles burn
in the chandelier and the light plays off of the
crystals to create an almost eerie atmosphere.
You also notice an elegant black walnut chest [2
gp], banded in gleaming copper in the corner of
the room. You approach the chest and find it is
not locked. Inside you discover a fascinating suit
of studded leather armor. As you lift it out of the
chest you can tell it has been lovingly crafted by
experienced hands [masterwork studded leather
armor, 175 gp]. After moving the armor aside
you find another set of identical armor. It is just
as expertly crafted, and if you compare them side
by side, the two suits of armor are exactly alike
[masterwork studded leather armor, 175 gp]. Under
the second set of armor you uncover a pair of
leather gauntlets which look as if they were
probably crafted by the same person who created
the two sets of studded leather [masterwork
leather gauntlets, 45gp]. Nothing else remains in
the chest, so you check the rest of the room, but
turn up nothing of value. Your attention turns
back to the exquisite chandelier hanging from
the center of the room. It looks as if it could easily
be taken down, but carrying it without ruining
it will be quite difficult [chandelier made of silver
with aquamarine, violet garnet, blue spinel and
golden yellow topaz crystals; value 4,600gp]. [Total
4,997 gp]
30 You have entered a room which looks as if it is
used specifically to simulate some sort of battle.
There is a very large table here with miniature
soldiers, some red and some white, lined up all
along the edge [The soldiers are made of lead. Each
army has 100 pieces; 50 gp per set.] In the center
of the table are miniature buildings, all made of
pewter about a hand high. [The buildings represent
common town structures such as: a temple, the
town hall, a tavern, large houses, and groups of
small houses. 20 buildings; 240 gp each.] As you
approach and investigate further you notice the
miniature soldiers are interspersed among the
buildings. The two different colors of paint on
the soldiers must represent two different armies.
There are also six ivory dice [15 sp each] sitting
on the table perhaps to represent certain random
events. Regardless of its purpose, the buildings
are quite impressive, and would probably
fetch a fare amount of coin if sold to the right
person. [Total 4,909 gp]
31 You find a locked trunk bound in brass [Average
lock; 46 gp], and a sturdy chest, also locked
[Average lock; 42 gp]. The trunk is lined with
cedar and in the top is a length of pale wool [3
gp]. Unfolding the fabric reveals a dress of black
the mother of all treasure tables
94
silk, trimmed with black lace and tiny beads of
jet [royal outfit; 200 gp]. The dress would fit an
athletic woman of average height. It is tight fitting
past the hips, and then slit in front from
above the knee to allow the wearer to walk, with
a slight train in back. Lying below the dress is a
full-length fur cloak with a deep hood, of darkest
sable with a lining of black silk [760 gp]. A
flat box in the bottom of the trunk is made of
polished black wood [6 gp]. Inside, on silk
padding, lies a piece of onyx two inches in diameter
which has been carved into an exquisite
black flower. It hangs on a slender black leather
cord, accented by a few oval beads of jet and two
round carnelians [3,468 gp]. Next to this lies a
bracelet of carnelian beads, round and smooth,
in colors ranging from fiery red to nearly cranberry
dark [345 gp].
The chest holds a set of lacquered leather
armor, in blood red studded with brass studs [28
gp]. The armor was obviously made for a female
of average height, and would not fit a man well.
Below the armor lie some weapons: a hand
crossbow [100 gp], and a pair of daggers in red
leather sheaths on a matching belt. The daggers
are wickedly sharp, and each also has its hilt
wrapped with red leather [4 gp each]. A red
leather belt pouch [2 gp] holds an assortment of
coins [32 gp, 87 sp, 92 cp] and an unmarked vial
[antitoxin; 50 gp]. [Total 5,099.62 gp]
32 In the middle of the pile of treasure before you is
a pile of weapons stacked haphazardly. Sorting it
out you find what appears to be the equipment
of a patrol [possibly from a nearby city]. In the
center lie nine scimitars [15 gp each], nine badly
dented but serviceable bucklers [15 gp each], and
nine heavy crossbows [50 gp each]. Tied together
in an oddly tidy bundle are 180 quarrels for the
crossbows [10 per set; 18 sets, 1 gp each]. To the
side rest twenty upended saddlebags [4 gp each]
all pressed with the same seal, a wolf howling at
a cloudless sky. Across the room, seemingly
thrown against the wall, are nine saddles in
decent shape [20 gp each] and one gnawed
beyond repair. Underneath the saddles are nine
rusting suits of human sized chainmail [150 gp
each]. Mixed among the armor is the standard
pack of a soldier, ten sets of flint and steel [1 gp
each], and ten woolen blankets smelling of sweat
and blood [5 sp each]. A fallen knight sleeps in
the shadows of the corner, his lance [10 gp] and
shield [heavy steel shield, 20 gp] cast aside as he
fell. A longbow pokes over the back of his beaten
half-plate armor which even in the dimness
manages to catch and throw back the light [composite
longbow, 100 gp; masterwork half-plate, 900
gp], and as you approach the smell of rotting
flesh washes over, seeming to cling to clothes
and armor alike. In a well made scabbard at his
side is a falchion [masterwork, 375 gp]. In his side
pouch, showing a variation of the standard on
the saddlebags, are a pair of cylindrical objects: a
sunrod [2 gp], and a spyglass [1,000 gp] wrapped
in stained silk cloth [5 sp]. Clutched to his chest
in a death grip is a sack that when lifted, the
bottom falls out and a large collection of coins
spills out over the dead hero [200 gp, 210 sp, and
300 cp]. [Total 4,994.5 gp]
33 You locate a gigantic basket made of coiled rope
[rope basket, 5 gp]. The rope coils are as thick as
a man’s arm; the basket stands as tall as a dwarf
and almost as big around as it is tall. A lid, also
made of rope coils, rests on top of the basket,
covering it completely. Opening the basket is
difficult, since it is nearly impossible to grip the
lid from opposite sides, but with a little work,
you manage to lift it up on one side. With the lid
off, you are suddenly taken aback as you see the
head of an enormous snake coming up out of the
basket’s center! It takes you a moment, but you
realize it is not a real snake, but one made of precious
metal. The head is as big around as a fist,
and it coils down into a lake of copper [27,240
cp; weighs 545 pounds]. Now that you can see it
properly, you notice the fine detail work on the
snake itself. Its exposed fangs appear to be made
of ivory, and its eyes are small red and white
stones [fire opals]. Because of all of the copper
coins, you cannot see the entire snake, but it
appears to coil down into the money. [When the
coins are removed from the basket:] With the coins
removed, you can see the entire golden reptile.
It coils down all the way to the bottom of the
basket, with the head sitting a good three feet
above the base. The workmanship is excellent,
down to the detail of each scale. [The snake is
gold-plated iron; entire piece 4,750 gp.] [Total
5,027.4 gp]
34 Against the wall sits a low, sturdy bronze stand
with three flat tiers each a hand-span wide in a
quarter-circle shape [45 gp], evidently meant to
sit in a corner. It may be made for kneeling in
prayer, or to support a variety of household icons
or just to hold a collection of some kind. On the
lowest step lies a longsword in a battered leather
sheath. The hilt is covered with some type of
gray hide which looks almost like fish skin
[sharkskin], but it gives a very secure grip. The
blade is unornamented, dark gray, smooth and
gleaming [masterwork longsword, adamantine;
3,015 gp]. On the second step rests a green
leather backpack [2 gp]. Stuffed in the top is a
roll of brown fabric: a sturdy wool cloak [1 gp].
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
95
Another cloth bundle holds unguents, rolled
strips of linen, and other items [healer’s kit, 50
gp]. Slipped along the side of the pack is a
sheathed dagger with a green stone on the pommel
[green spinel]. The blade is gleaming silver
[alchemical silver; dagger, 122 gp]. In the bottom
of the pack is a matching green pouch [1 gp]
with coins [76 pp, 185 gp, 179 sp, 45 cp] and a
small green silk bag [2 gp]. In the bag a chain of
tiny copper beads holds a pendant of russet
amber [778 gp]. The rectangular pendant is as
long as a man’s thumb joint and two thirds of
that in width. A plain box [1 gp], a forearm’s
length wide, rests on the top tier, its ends nailed
shut. Inside lies a foot-tall standing shade of
glass with a heavy base meant to hold a thick
candle [24 gp]. It is covered with hundreds of
tiny glass tiles in a bright amber color. A candle
placed inside this lantern will produce a warm,
golden light. [Total 5,004.35 gp]
35 You come across a large hole in the floor [about
five feet deep], covered with cobwebs and the
dust of ages long past. A glint of shining yellow
catches your eye and through the filter of grey
and white you can make out a pile of coins at
the bottom [2,000 gp]. There are marks all
around this hole as if some kind of scuffle or battle
had taken place. Upon closer examination of
the depths there is more to this than a simple
pile of gold; several items also rest at odd angles
in the hole. A double-bladed steel battle axe
pokes up, resting on the side of one of the
blades. Faceted red gems [red spinels] are set
around the point where the metal joins into the
wood, creating a crown or base of sorts [battle axe
1,000 gp]. A small lock box inlaid with glittering
gold in the shape of a dragon [Average lock; box
50 gp] seems to swim upwards from the coin
hoard, the lid thrown back and open to reveal a
small black egg-shaped jewel [black pearl, 1,650
gp] inside it. A finely made brass drinking
tankard [340 gp] also lies partially submerged in
the toss of coin. It is inlaid with jet, and the
handle is made from a dark stained wood. [On
the underside of the tankard is written in the common
language: “Where e’er we walk and all is dark,
take heart and heed the torches’ spark; take shorter
route in kinsman’s cave or sleep forever in shallow
grave”.] [Total 5,040 gp]
36 You find an old, low cot [5 gp] covered in a disarray
of blankets and linens [2 blankets, 5 sp
each; linens, 1 gp] and a large feather pillow [2
gp]. Under the cot is a huge box measuring
almost the full length and width of the bed and
nearly a foot high [8 gp]. The box is made of
wood with metal caps on the corners and a brass
clasp, currently unlatched. This box holds a
number of compartments visible when it is
opened. By far, the largest part of the box is a
huge collection of glass beads, each with a small
hole drilled through the center. The beads are in
every conceivable color, size, and shape; and
judging by the size of the compartment, they
number in the tens of thousands [500 gp total].
Mixed in with the beads are five spools of wire
[5 gp each] and a complete set of jeweler’s tools
[masterwork, 55 gp]. The central compartment of
the box holds sets of jewelry made from the variety
of glass beads — a small mountain of
bracelets and necklaces, all of different colors
and sizes [103 bracelets, 4 gp each; 72 necklaces, 7
gp each]. Resting in a small compartment is a
fine magnifying glass [100 gp] and an hourglass
with what appears to be gold dust in place of the
sand [75 gp]. Finally, the last compartment holds
a collection of coins in what looks to be equal
amounts of platinum, gold and silver [all from the
local kingdom, 300 pp, 300 gp, 300 sp]. [Total
5,018 gp]
37 You find a polished wooden chest [15 gp] lined
with padded white silk. The outside panels are
carved with a wedding scene and stylized lilies.
Inside the top of the chest, a fitted tray holds a
pair of engraved silver steins [75 gp each]. Silver
cherubs with gilt wings wrap the painted black
base of each stein. The handle and rims have
also been gilded. The caps are topped with tiny
statues, of a man and a woman in wedding garments.
Inside the bride’s stein is a woolen packet
[1 sp] containing a necklace with a golden
clasp which has alternating pea-sized beads of
pale green [citrine] and pink [rhodochrosite]. The
clasp has a fiery opal on it and looks like a pendant
when the necklace is worn [3,525 gp].
Tucked into the groom’s stein is a woolen packet
[1 sp] with a handful of coins [33 pp]. When
you lift the tray with the steins out of the chest,
you find three matching silver pieces [45 gp
each]: two plates with wedding scenes and one
serving platter depicting a couple with a newborn
child. The plates have black and gilt
detailing on the rims. Under these are ten
matching yet less ornate silver place settings.
Each place setting has a stein [50 gp each] and a
plate [30 gp each]. Along with the place settings
are twelve matching sets of silver cutlery [5 gp
per set]. [Total 5,015.2 gp]
38 Braced against the back of the room is a safe —
large, bulky, and made of steel [50 gp]. The door
is currently open, and if there ever was a lock on
it, there is no evidence of it now. There is a shelf
about a third of the way from the top holding a
the mother of all treasure tables
96
large, flat wooden box [5 gp]. Inside is a golden
choker necklace strung with long, cylindrical
beads made of glass. Three of the beads are outlined
in gold and hold small lustrous, dark green
gems [emeralds; necklace, 2,250 gp]. The entire
piece is large, but the opening for the neck is
small, as if sized for a child or an elf. On the bottom
of the safe is a sheaf of papers, all scribbled
on in something other than Common [Gnome or
Draconic]. [Providing someone can read the papers:]
While they are in no order, they appear to be
the journal of someone exploring the ruins of an
old temple [at least 100 miles distant]. The papers
do provide a map of the area, as well as of the
structure itself [journal with map, 50 gp]. Under
the papers are three small golden figures, all
carved in the shape of the sun [or other religious
shape; religious icons to a local sun god, 25 gp each].
Behind the icons sits a large wooden box [5 gp].
The lid lifts up to reveal a series of crossed
dividers inside, making 35 vertical compartments.
Fifteen have coins stacked in them: four
hold stacks of platinum [50 pp each], while ten
more are filled with gold [50 gp each]. The fifteenth
slot is only partially filled, and holds a
few loose coins [5 pp, 20 gp]. [Total 5,005 gp]
39 A very large sack leans against a pile of wolf
pelts [6 wolf pelts; 10 gp each] next to a portable
anvil [40 gp]. In the sack you find four blue velvet
pillows embroidered with similar seascapes
in gold thread [4 pillows, 30 gp each], a tall silver
vase decorated with abstract lines and squares
[vase, 30 gp], and a piece of cloth woven of gold,
sized to cover a six-person table [gold cloth, 250
gp]. A large leather wallet [3 gp] holds dried meat
[5 pounds; 3 gp], dried apples [5 pounds, 1 gp] and
roasted walnuts [10 pounds; 1 gp]. Another
pouch contains six ivory combs [10 gp each], a
wooden mirror [10 gp], a silver mirror with small
garnets around the edge [600 gp], and a jeweled
tiara [silver with 25 small pieces of amber; 1,300
gp]. A narrow leather box lies atop the pile of
pelts and holds five golden rings and various
sizes of files, picks, tweezers and the like [masterworks
thieves’ tools; 100 gp]. Two rings are plain
gold [20 gp each], one has elaborate knotwork
over all its surfaces [45 gp], one has a large black
pearl [550 gp] and the last is set with two small
opals [1,100 gp]. At the bottom of the sack you
find a silver ladle [2 gp], a large leather bucket [2
sp], a massive silver brooch with four colors of
agate [180 gp], a large warhammer [2 gp], two
handaxes [6 gp each] and numerous coins [398
gp, 723 sp, 802 cp]. [Total 4,987.52 gp]
40 Heaped on the ground in front of you is a gigantic
pile of coins. While it seems to be predominantly
copper, you can see pockets of silver and
bits of gold shining through [1,021 gp, 8,455 sp,
112,397 cp]. The top of the pile is concave, as if
something has been resting on it. As you begin
to clear away the coins, you find several other
items of interest. Near the edge of the pile is a
scimitar encased in an elaborately decorated
scabbard. The scabbard looks and feels like
ivory, and is covered in bas-relief carvings of
military scenes [ivory scabbard, 75 gp]. The hilt
of the scimitar is wrapped with gold wire, while
the blade is etched with a wave pattern, and
feels too heavy to be wielded properly [ornamental
scimitar, 50 gp]. Further toward the center is a
brass gong one foot in diameter. With it is its
wooden [bamboo] stand, as well as a small mallet
[gong set, 35 gp]. At the bottom of the heap of
coins is a large golden coffer nearly three feet
square and a foot high [coffer, 750 gp]. The interior
of the case is padded, and holds a water
clock [1,000 gp] which, thanks to the case, is in
perfect condition, albeit without a source of
water. A large piece of canvas [3 square yards; 1
gp each] is wrapped around a bulky item next to
it. Unwrapping it reveals a shocking site: the
canvas conceals the body of a slain human, now
nothing but bones. The deceased’s clothing is
nothing but tatters, but he or she was bound
with two sets of manacles [2 masterwork manacles;
50 gp each] which look functional. The keys
rest a few feet away, under the coins. [Total
5,003.47 gp]
41 You nearly stumble as you enter the room. Your
shins hit a small mosaic-covered stool [100 gp]
inlaid with dark woods and ivory chips and you
almost fall onto an intricately decorated table
[700 gp]. Set haphazardly by the table are five
other matching stools [100 gp each]. Lying on the
table are two small wooden boxes [2 gp each].
One holds carved ivory and bone pieces of varying
sizes [set of ivory and bone pieces, 50 gp]. The
other holds three sets of small decorated parchments,
a little smaller than the palm of a man’s
hand [1-78 card fortune-telling deck, 33 gp; 2-54
card decks, 22 gp each]. Nearby a multi-colored
round board is leaning against the wall [3 gp],
next to a hand-span long box [1 gp] holding a
score of darts [20 darts; 2 sp each]. It looks like
someone is either planning to set up a gambling
den, or stole all the equipment from one. To
your left is a walnut cabinet [250 gp] that opens
to reveal a crate [1 gp] with 20 bottles of fine
wine [10 gp each], and a shelf holding boxes [3
boxes; 1 gp each] with 10 mugs [4 sp each]; 10 fluted
wine glasses [2 gp each]; and a box of 20 good
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
97
white candles [1 sp each]. Nearby is a pyramid of
6 barrels [2 gp each] lying on their sides. [The top
barrel has been tapped, and is empty. It still smells
of fine ale. The remaining barrels are full, holding
about 20 gallons. 5 barrels of ale; 12 gp each]
Stacked on the barrels is a squeeze box [5 gp], 2
whistles [2 gp each], a harp [5 gp] and a drum [5
gp]. Across the way is a chest. It is standing open
and is full of silken outfits and undergarments
which one would see in a bawdy house [courtier’s
outfits suitable for ladies of the evening; 5 outfits, 30
gp each; in a secret compartment in the chest is a
scroll with a list of names and amounts — priceless].
Against one wall is a long lidless wooden
box with chalk markings inside [1 gp] and a
small box resting on it [5 sp]. The small box
holds 2 pairs of carved ivory cubes [2 pair of ivory
dice; 55 gp a pair] and 2 sets of carved rectangular
jet stones [2 sets of jet chips; 100 gp a set]. As
you look back toward the door, you see a small
carved wooden table you missed [25 gp]. On it
rests a box [1 gp] with an ink vial [8 gp], 3 ink
pens [10 sp each], and 2 sheets of parchment [20
sp each]. Behind the table stands a matching
carved wooden chair [18 gp], nearly covered by a
fur-trimmed wool cloak [50 gp]. There is a pouch
in each of the two pockets of the cloak. One
pouch contains a signet ring [5 gp] and ten gems
[fire opal, 1000 gp; blue sapphire 1000 gp; 3 lapis
lazuli, 10 gp each; 5 freshwater pearls, 10 gp each].
The other pouch contains coins [30 pp, 33 gp,
70 sp, 100 cp]. [Total 5,006.5]
42 There is a series of old wooden crates stacked up
against the wall. Each of the 48 crates is approximately
one cubit long in each dimension [5 sp
each]. Forty-six crates contain a mixture of dried
root vegetables and dried fruit [46 crates with
fruit and vegetables 10 gp each], while the other
two have more precious cargoes. Opening the
first of these two crates [the best way to do it is to
lever off the lid with a suitable tool] reveals two
sheepskin fleeces [4 gp each] in the midst of
which is a large black candle about as wide
across as an apple [10 gp]. [Hidden inside the candle
are seven small diamonds, worth 330 gp each.
These would be revealed by burning the candle,
which would not damage the diamonds themselves.]
In the second crate are some religious idols,
packed with carded wool to keep them safe
[wool, 2 sp]. One statuette, about the height of
an arrow, depicts a demonic figure with wings,
horns and wicked looking fangs. The statuette is
made of gold with gleaming amber eyes [920 gp].
The next item is of marble and glitters with gilt
and tiny shards of jet and crystal. It is about half
the height of the first statuette but much wider
and it depicts what seems to be a ritual killing.
A figure has been lashed to an altar and seven
priests are tormenting it with flails and whips
[statuette 790 gp]. The third and final item is a
very beautiful statue executed in ivory of two
young women entwined in an embrace [540 gp].
[Total 5,062.2 gp].
43 The first thing you notice is the jumble of bones
that lie on the floor and are attached at different
angles to the wall. They all seem to be cleaned
and polished. They are connected by a complex
web of threads and cords, looking like nothing so
much as a giant spider’s web. There are also other
items caught up in the web. What seemed initially
just to be lumps in the weft and warp of the
interlocking threads appear, on further examination,
to be treasures of different sorts. The first
one you focus on is at about eye level for an average
human and, carefully pulling it from the
restraining threads, you are surprised to find a
glass bottle containing a highly detailed model of
a galleon. The little ship is made from exotic
woods, ivory, and silk and is entirely too large to
have entered through the bottle’s narrow neck
[ship in a bottle, 800 gp]. A little behind and below
this is a second lump of thread which, when
pushed aside, reveals a thin fabric bag [1 sp] holding
a set of three silver pots [23 gp each] and two
brushes [9 gp each]. Investigating further, it seems
the pots contain gold paint, suitable for application
on religious icons and the like [gold paint, 57
gp per pot]. Towards the left hand side and about
halfway back in the web is a much larger canvas
bundle which was hidden at first by the thick
cords. This bundle is as long as a longsword and,
indeed, once you have unwrapped the canvas
covering [2 sp], you find four such weapons. Each
sword is of exquisite quality. [An expert would
notice they are forged from meteoric iron; 4 masterwork
longswords, 360 gp each]. Each scabbard is
decorated with five deep red stones [garnets]
arranged in the form of a cross [4 scabbards, 650
gp each]. [Total 5,098.3 gp]
44 You have entered a room obviously belonging to
a person who was of small stature, possibly a
halfling or gnome. All of the furniture [bed, 16
gp; desk, 16 gp; nightstand, 4 gp; chair, 8 gp] is
smaller than what a human-sized creature could
comfortably use. Lying on the bed is a shining
suit of small-sized full plate mail armor [will fit
halflings, gnomes, and other small creatures; weighs
25 pounds, 1,650 gp]. It looks as if it has never
seen battle, but it is definitely crafted well and
would provide great protection for someone
small enough to fit into it. As you finish examining
the armor you are drawn toward the desk,
where a short sword sits [masterwork silvered short
the mother of all treasure tables
sword; 330 gp]. The silvery blade looks as if it has
never seen battle either, but it is amazingly
sharp, so it should fare well if used in combat. [If
the adventurers check the desk drawers:] Rifling
through the desk drawers will yield several items
of interest. First you come across a flat golden
case [125 gp] holding three golden ink pens [23
gp each], definitely the writing tools of a wealthy
person. In another drawer you find a long
leather case [4 gp] which holds a finely crafted
spyglass [1,000 gp]. Finally in the bottom drawer
of the desk you discover a polished wooden box
with a lock on it [Average lock, 46 gp]. Inside you
discover a golden necklace with an emerald set
into it [1,320 gp]. After ensuring nothing else of
value is in the desk you check the rest of the
room. Other than the furniture you find nothing.
[If the party has removed the armor from the
bed, they may notice something:] You notice the
bed mattress appears to have a lump in the center,
something you did not observe before. [If the
party decides to look under the mattress:] You look
under the mattress and find a wide, flat metal
box in the center [Good lock, 110 gp], the cause
of the lump you noticed. The box has a good
lock and holds several hundred gold pieces [390
gp]. [Total 5,088 gp]
45 You enter a room lit by two torches [2 ever-burning
torches, 110 gp each]. There is a bed [2 gp]
along one wall with three blankets [3 sp each], a
table [5 gp] with a half-eaten chicken, a pewter
tankard [4 gp] of stale ale, two empty wine bottles
[2 gp each] and a clay plate [2 cp] with four
burnt out candle stubs. In the fireplace hang
two iron pots [5 sp each], while nearby is piled
five days worth of firewood [5 cp]. Also near the
fireplace stands a huge barrel [flour, 400 pounds;
8 gp]. Above it from the ceiling dangles several
slabs of smoked meat [bacon, 10 slabs, 5 pounds
each; 3 gp each] and on the wall hangs a canvas
bag which smells strongly of spices. Inside are
six pouches [1 gp each] of various sizes, which
contain: cinnamon [5 pounds, 5 gp], cloves [2
pounds, 30 gp], ginger [3 pounds, 48 gp], dried
herbs [1 pound, 5 sp], black pepper [3 pounds, 6
gp], and salt [10 pounds, 50 gp]. Against one wall
is a plain wardrobe [10 gp] with its door ajar; you
see it holds several outfits. There are three old
tunics [3 sp each], one threadbare cloak [4 sp], 2
newer traveling outfits [2 gp each], winter weather
gear [8 gp], 2 backpacks [2 gp each], and a pair
of old slippers [5 sp]. Next to the wardrobe is a
medium-sized chest [4 gp] with a flat top. As you
try to open the lid, there is a muffled “clink!”
and one side of the front swings open a little.
[The lid is solid; the front opens like a small cupboard.]
The chest is filled with small wooden
boxes of all shapes and sizes. Several of the
boxes [7 boxes, 2 sp each] contain small flasks,
nested in grasses, tufts of fabric, and padding. A
quick inventory yields: 12 flasks of acid [10 gp
each], 12 flasks of alchemist’s fire [20 gp each], 24
vials of antitoxin [50 gp each], 12 empty flasks [3
cp each], an hourglass [25 gp], 10 vials of ink [8
gp each], 10 ink pens [1 sp each], 10 bars of iron
[1 pound each, 1 sp each], 5 vials of quicksilver
[100 gp each], 2 magnifying glasses [100 gp each],
2 sets of scales [2 gp each], and a smooth leather
cylinder with two concave glass circles [2 gp
unless characters realize it is a disassembled spyglass;
1,000 gp]. At the bottom of the chest is a
covered basket [2 sp] with 10 leather bags of
some thick liquid [10 tanglefoot bags, 50 gp each]
and a small chest with complex locking mechanism
[Amazing lock; chest, 152 gp]. The small
chest is full of a mixture of coins and jewels [3
moss agates, 10 gp each; 3 carnelians, 50 gp each;
3 red garnets, 100 gp each; 25 gp, 17 sp, 13 cp].
[Total 4,984.06]
46 This room has an odd group of items in it.
Scattered haphazardly throughout the room are
several statues made of clear crystal. Each statue
is knee high and each one is made of a different
type of crystal, distinguishable by slightly different
hues [such as pink, yellow, soft blue, etc]. The
interesting thing about the statues is there seems
to be one for every civilized race in the realm,
and each race is depicted in a very gallant and
refined way. [There are seven statues which represent
human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, halfling, gnome
and half-orc; 715 gp each. The GM may need to
alter this if a world includes other races or does not
use ones listed here.] [Total 5,005 gp]
47 Lying in front of you is an elaborate gilded wall
sconce with three holders for candles [gilded
wood; 35 gp]. One holder is at the center top
with one on either side below it, all supported by
swirls of golden leaves. Below the center holder
is a semicircular shelf, supported by still more
swirling leaves. Lying beneath the sconce is a
polished brass tray three hand-spans wide, its
flat circular base surrounded by an inch-high
cutwork edge [15 gp].
Next to those items sits a square wooden box
[2 gp] more than a foot high. Opening its hinged
lid, you see first a silver statue of a mermaid, sitting
on a rock, surrounded by gold and white
bubbles [2,290 gp]. The figure is about a foot tall,
and her long hair and tail are covered with gold.
The bubbles are white and golden pearls in a
variety of sizes. Beside the statue sits a hollow
gold ball the size of a large apple, with cutwork
in a pattern of lilies, which rests in an ornate
98
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
99
three-legged holder [78 gp]. It is filled with
flower petals (slightly crushed) and dried herbs,
giving off a faint, sweet fragrance.
The box also contains a bronze jar about a
hand-span tall [30 gp] with a round foot sweeping
up to a wide, cup-shaped body decorated
with fern leaves. The stopper (also bronze) is in
the shape of a flower bud. The jar holds a fabricwrapped
bundle, which proves to be a square of
linen [1 gp] wrapped around three pieces of jewelry.
A gold cuff, a hand’s breadth wide, is set
with a thick oval piece of amber as big as a
thumb joint [890 gp]. Accompanying it is a
chain of gold links with a matching piece of
amber set in a gold oval frame [1,014 gp]. In
addition, there is a bracelet, formed of five polished
but irregular pieces of onyx each larger
than a woman’s thumbnail and set into linked
frames of silver [618 gp]. [Total 4,973 gp]
48 You find a square chest with brass hinges [3 gp],
bound shut with leather straps. In it is a large,
rolled tapestry over a pace wide, wedged in at an
angle. The tapestry, when unrolled, is about ten
feet long and seems to depict the crowning of a
king. The figures shown are all longer and thinner
than most people you have ever seen. The
central figure is a man in red and purple robes
which immediately draws your gaze. His eyes
flash a brilliant green and above his head is a
crown of gold thread, now slightly tarnished.
Behind him stands a white-haired man in a skyblue
robe, and above them rises a tan stone arch
trimmed in gold. It reaches from edge to edge of
the tapestry, but no supports for it are shown.
On the steps below the level of the king stand
other people, dressed as nobility. There are two
on either side, plus partial pieces of clothing evidently
from other people. This tapestry is finished
on both edges, so it does not look as if any
of it has just been cut off. [This is the center of a
series of five panels. The king’s eyes are emeralds,
1000 gp each. Total tapestry: 2890 gp.] Tucked in
below the tapestry is a well made sack of heavy
lavender wool [2 gp]. In it is a polished rosewood
box [2 gp] the size of a man’s palm. It contains a
piece of white silk [1 gp] wrapped around a
bracelet of seventeen silvery pearls, each the size
of a large fat pea, strung on silken thread with a
silver clasp [1950 gp]. Another sturdy sack, of
plain gray fabric [5 sp] holds a double handful of
coins [38 gp, 127 sp, 486 cp]. [Total 4,904.06 gp]
49 You find an old leather satchel with an ebony
handle, quite large and somewhat bulky. There is
a simple clasp which folds over from one side of
the bag to the other; the leather, while slightly
dusty, still seems to be in good condition, lacking
any real damage and only worn in a few places
[leather tome bag, 10 gp]. In the bag are three
books. They look to be in reasonable condition
and have only a slight layer of dust on them. The
books show no titles; the covers are blank except
for a strange diamond symbol on the front with a
single gemstone at the center of each. The first
book is a dull red and set with a cut green stone
[emerald], it is the largest of the set and has
slightly worn edges [book with emerald, 1,015 gp].
The medium-sized tome has a glimmering red
stone [fire opal] set against a black leather cover
[book with fire opal, 1,015 gp]. The third book is
dull green leather and is quite small compared to
the other two; this one has a series of small red
gems [red spinels] arranged around the gleaming
central white stone [opal; book, 1,715 gp]. These
books are all blank. [If the bag is searched:] Deeper
inside the bag you find a false bottom, which
holds a small piece of linen [5 sp] wrapped
around a square wooden box [1 gp]. The box
holds a selection of five small gemstones, in a
mix of colors and shapes [aquamarine, violet garnet,
black pearl, deep blue spinel, golden yellow
topaz; 250 gp each]. [Total 5,006.5 gp]
50 Before you is some noble’s personal carriage [100
gp]. The dark wood is decorated with engravings
of rearing horses, while the handle of the door is
a carving of a horse’s head. Enough gear for a
small armory rests behind the carriage, perhaps
guards’ equipment. In a heap still smelling faintly
of sweat and blood lie four suits of splint mail
[200 gp each]. Beside the armor is a conglomeration
of ordinary weapons: one short sword [10
gp], two throwing axes [8 gp each], a flail [8 gp],
one heavy mace [12 gp], a longbow [75 gp], and
three bucklers [15 gp each].
A magnificently crafted greatsword stands
against the side of the carriage, a dark gem
[hematite] in the pommel contrasting with the
spotless blade [masterwork; 375 gp]. There are
two chests [2 gp each] on the back of the carriage.
The one marked ‘dowry’ reveals a great quantity
of coins [15 pp, 1,670 gp, 6,800 sp]. The other
one contains clothes for a woman of noble birth:
a black silk dress, a green satin blouse with
matching skirt, and two violet gowns [4 noble
outfits, 75 gp each]. Carefully folded underneath
these is a dark red dress [wedding dress; 150 gp].
It is not gaudy like some dresses but rather sleek,
with a long train; the material is a smooth silk
and is the color of a fine merlot [deep red
wine]. Under the dress sits a small jewel box [4
gp]. Inside you see a platinum necklace with a
large red and green speckled gem at its center
[bloodstone; necklace, 450 gp], and a pair of
matching earrings [150 gp]. [Total 4,999 gp]
the mother of all treasure tables
100
51 In front of you stands a trio of trophy cases —
wooden legged and sided with glass tops — each
one holding a collection of treasures on display
[3 trophy cases, 50 gp each]. A fourth case lies
nearby, smashed with a large rock which still sits
in the center of the rubble. Each of the cases is
locked with a well made padlock, including the
smashed case [4 Good padlocks; 80 gp each despite
the missing keys]. The first case holds a sextant
decorated with seven pearls. Six of the pearls are
small and white, while the seventh is larger and
jet black [sextant 1,200 gp]. The sextant is resting
on a map of the known world, or at least the
world as it was known several hundred years previous.
Fanciful drawings illuminate the map, of
gigantic creatures, dire monsters, and strange
humanoids [old map, 100 gp]. The second case
holds a jeweled crown, orb, and scepter. [At first
glance, they appear to be truly regal objects, but a
closer inspection shows them to be reproductions.
Rather than diamonds and rubies, the gems are
merely clear quartz and deep red garnet, but the
pieces are attractive nonetheless. Crown, 800 gp;
orb, 300 gp; scepter, 400 gp.] The third case holds
what looks like someone’s gear: armor, shield
and weapon. The chain shirt still sparkles
brightly through the dust on the glass [mithril
shirt, 1,100 gp]. Next to it is a large flail with two
heads [dire flail, 90 gp] and a steel shield painted
with a wolf’s head [heavy steel shield, 20 gp].
[Closer inspection will reveal the third case has an
easily discovered false bottom containing coins. 440
gp, 1,553 sp.] [Total 5,075.3 gp]
52 Pulling back the floor-length curtains reveals an
astonishing sight: dozens of logs and boughs of
wood are stacked neatly against the wall. They
come in a range of lengths from just larger than
a man’s arm in length and breadth up to the
breadth of a man’s body and ten paces in length.
Each log has been carefully cut and polished so
as to display the beauty of its grain and remove
any danger of splinters. Many of the logs are
hardy and rare hard woods of considerable value.
Even the less valuable logs would still be useful
to any master carpenter or lesser workman [37
logs; value 3,000 gp]. Behind the logs and standing
against the wall are eight long bolts of silk.
Each consists of a central wooden spindle [spindles,
2 sp each] around which the material is
tightly wound. From the size of the bolts, it looks
like each would amount to perhaps twenty to
thirty yards in length of silk. Three bolts are a
plain but elegant purple in color [3 bolts, 24 yards
per bolt; 240 gp each] while two others boast a
checkered red and blue pattern [2 bolts, 19 yards
per bolt; 190 gp each]. The remaining two have
complex patterns featuring dozens of different
colors and are quite beautiful to behold [3 bolts,
30 yards per bolt; 300 gp each]. Clearly, work of
this quality must have taken many hundreds of
hours of labor to complete. [Total 5,001.6 gp].
53 A trapdoor set into the floor [ground] would
have been concealed but a carpet [pile of leaves]
has been partly moved away to reveal its location.
It is unlocked, though a bit stiff. You lift it
and look below into a large open space, only to
see a canvas covering everything [46 square
yards; 1 gp per yard]. Pulling away the canvas
exposes a number of barrels [25 barrels; 2 gp each]
of various sizes but all of a standard shape. Many
are marked with the names of various ports of
the region. There are also two sturdy chests. Six
of the barrels are labeled as carrying rum and
would hold approximately six gallons each [6
barrels of rum, 6 gallons each; 35 gp per gallon, 210
gp per barrel]. [All barrels contents are exactly as
labeled. Opening the barrels to test them reduces the
life of the contents from eighteen months to a few
weeks.] Six others are labeled as containing salt
pork and are twice the size of the rum barrels [6
barrels of salt pork, 75 pounds each; 6 sp per pound,
45 gp per barrel]. Three are marked as cloves [or
gunpowder] and are slightly smaller than the rum
barrels [3 barrels of cloves (or gunpowder), 30
pounds each; 15 gp per pound, 450 gp per barrel].
The remaining ten barrels are marked as containing
tea leaves [or tobacco] and are the same
size as the rum barrels [10 barrels of tea (or tobacco),
36 pounds; 5 sp per pound, 18 gp per barrel].
The two chests [2 gp each] are both bound with
chains [two 10 foot chains; 30 gp each], which are
fastened by strong locks [2 Good locks; 80 gp
each]. When you get them open, you find they
both hold coins, though the combinations are
very different. One is all silver and copper [360
sp, 3,600 cp], while the other is mostly gold [17
pp, 1,340 gp, 390 sp]. [This cargo was originally
salvaged from a shipwreck; survivors from the ship
were drowned by the salvagers.] [Total 5,001 gp]
54 Someone has created an indoor garden, having
installed a plot of earth perhaps ten paces along
the long side and six paces along the short side.
Various rose bushes have been planted artistically
in the plot and a watering can and hoe lie to
one side. Of course you wish to dig up the earth
to see what is hidden and your efforts are
rewarded as you located first an oil cloth sack [5
sp] containing a small statue of a fertility goddess
in platinum [statue, 1,000 gp] and a small linen
purse [5 sp] containing several gold coins [50 gp].
After some more poking around, you find a stout
wooden chest [Good lock, 84 gp] locked with no
key. [If it can be opened:] The chest is found to
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
101
contain a ceremonial silver dagger with a large
aquamarine set in its pommel [dagger, 1,250 gp]
inside a leather scabbard set with five small
rubies [scabbard, 500 gp], as well as a crystal scrying
ball [non-magical crystal ball, 450 gp] and a
dozen preserved quails’ eggs coated with gilt and
painted in bright, exquisite colors [12 eggs, 50 gp
each]. The last find is a large wooden chest
[Amazing lock, 152 gp], unlocked. Opening the
chest produces a cornucopia of complex spicy
smells wafting through the nostrils. The contents
of the chest may have mixed slightly; however,
careful digging reveals five compartments.
The first compartment contains white crystals
somewhat hard to the touch [20 pounds of salt, 5
gp each], the next compartment shimmers with
brick-red filaments [10 pounds saffron, 15 gp
each], and the third contains little brown
nuggets with stems [10 pounds of cloves, 15 gp
each]. The fourth section glitters with a flaky
powder [1 pound of platinum powder, 500 gp] and
the last compartment holds a series of tiny silver
weights, scales, scoops, and spoons [150 gp].
[Total 5,231 gp]
55 The center of the room holds a fire pit with a
large iron pot [5 sp] above it. The pot has flakes
of what appears to be gold paint on the inside
[actually gold from forging operation, 3 gp]. Lined
up along the wall are rows of small gray statuettes,
each identical in appearance. Each one
depicts a replica of a building [the local lord’s castle,
fortress or stronghold]. They appear to be
made of iron, but when you pick one up, it is
much too heavy, weighing about a pound. On
closer inspection, it looks more like lead, but the
one in your hand has a long scratch on the bottom.
Under the scratch, the statuette is gold!
All of them are made of solid gold and painted
to disguise them. Counting quickly, you locate
62 of the statuettes [62 statues, 55 gp each]. In
the corner, you find a large pile of canvas [a tent,
missing stakes and tent poles; 5 gp] covering two
paint pots half full with gray paint [paint pots, 1
gp each] and a pair of brushes [2 paint brushes, 1
sp each]. Also under the canvas are a small stack
of gold ingots [30 ingots, 50 gp each] and a set of
well used tools [masterwork goldsmithing tools; 55
gp] which still appear to be completely functional.
Rolled up inside the canvas is a small leather
satchel with a leather strap and steel buckles
[satchel 2 gp]. It holds a decorative fountain pen
[ 2 gp], twelve sheets of paper [4 sp each] and a
leather purse [1 gp] containing a few handfuls of
gold and silver coins [81 gp, 146 sp]. [Total
5,081.1 gp]
56 As you scan the area, the only place in this room
which looks as if it may hold items of value is a
large desk sitting in the corner [45 gp]. You
approach and begin to go through the drawers.
In the center drawer you find several sheets of
plain paper [8 pages, 4 sp each], moving them
aside, you discover a deck of playing cards. The
cards are unique, each having a thin layer of
gold leaf affixed to the corners making the cards
weighty and pricey [deck, 105 gp]. Beside the
cards is a small blunt knife-shaped instrument
with a hematite blade and a platinum handle.
[letter opener, 55 pp]. You go through the other
drawers, and in the lowest one on the left side of
the desk you find seven dice which appear to be
made of platinum. The cubes are very heavy;
holding them you estimate each one weighs
about a pound [7 platinum dice, 1 inch square, 1
pound each; 51 pp each]. You gently set these
aside and continue your search of the drawers,
but find nothing else of interest until you get to
the lower right hand drawer. There you find
three golden darts, the type used to throw at a
dartboard, not the type you would use as a
weapon. They are finely crafted and fletched
with eagle feathers [3 darts; 25 gp each]. You
check the drawers one last time and find a
pouch [2 sp] containing silvery coins in the back
corner [70 pp, 47 sp]. [Total 5,053.1 gp]
57 Arrayed in a row on the floor is a most peculiar
series of objects. Looking from left to right, you
encounter four large glass bottles, tightly stoppered
with rubber bungs. Inside is a clear liquid
with a strong pungent smell [formaldehyde; 4
large glass bottles, 200 gp each]. Next to these bottles
is a flat wooden box [1 gp] which, when
opened, reveals six metal implements ranging
from a few inches to a foot and a half in length
lying on a bed of green velvet. Each tool has a
short wooden grip and a business end, pointed
and curved. [These scrapers are used to draw the
organs from the body — especially the brain, which
is extracted in pieces through the nose; set 200 gp].
Next in line is a set of four very large, empty
alabaster containers half the height of a man
and as broad as a small tree. These have
alabaster bungs with rubber rings [4 canoptic jars
for storing organs and body parts; 150 gp each].
Then, there is a second box [1 gp], this one taller
than the first but smaller in other dimensions,
about the size of a cosmetics case. Inside this box
are sixteen different bottles of paint in various
shades from white through pink to brown and
then black [these paints restore the semblance of life
to a corpse; 100 gp]. Finally, there are six very fat
bolts of cloth [6 bolts, 55 yards each, 550 gp each],
of a very fine, cream-colored silk. This silk is
the mother of all treasure tables
102
exceptionally smooth to the touch [This is silk for
embalming shrouds and they have been treated to
make the cloth non-flammable]. [Total 5,002 gp]
58 You find five coats of excellent chainmail [masterwork;
300 gp each], with five finely wrought
helms [25 gp each]. The helms are decorated
with mountain scenes and have brass-plated
nose guards with knotwork patterns. In one of
the helmets there is a small leather pouch [1 gp]
containing two red gems [garnets; 100 gp each]
and an assortment of coins [16 pp, 15 gp, 5 sp].
To the side are a mix of axes and belts. There are
four wide leather belts with large brass buckles,
the angular knotwork designs upon them forming
vaguely cross-like patterns [12 gp each]. You
also find five high-quality battle axes with hafts
not quite as long as your arm, decorated with
extensive bronze engravings upon the blades
[masterwork; 310 gp each]. The axes and helms
are not only beautiful works of art in their own
right but are also very functional and efficient in
design. Beside the weapons are three backpacks
[2 gp each]. Each pack holds a blanket [5 sp each]
and two sacks [1 sp each] of gold coins [240 gp per
sack]. [Total 5,047.6 gp]
59 You come across an elongated container resembling
a sarcophagus, as long as an average man
and made from a deep yellow-colored metal
[gold-plated wooden sarcophagus, 3,700 gp; weight
about 120 pounds]. The box comes in two parts
and the lid is locked to the base with four metal
clasps, each one set with a tiny metal lever.
[Amazing lock, The four levers alone will not open
the box.] The clasps resemble dragon heads and
the small levers are crafted to look like dragons’
tongues. The top of the box features the image
of a serene and regal-looking woman lying in a
state of repose, her hands clasping a golden
orchid between her fingers. [Upon further examination
of the carved figure, adventurers may find a
small hidden lever under the orchid. This final lever
will release the mechanism allowing the sarcophagus
to be opened.] Upon a bed of pristine red velvet
[50 gp] lies an ancient skeleton still wrapped in
purple robes of fine quality [royal outfit, 200 gp],
trimmed with gold thread and seemingly
untouched by time. Trails of wispy silver-white
hair flow like a snowy avalanche from the figure
in repose, which still maintains an air of serenity
despite the grin of death upon her skull. A
carved ivory orchid [50 gp] lies still clasped
between her bone-white hands, and a single, silver
ring glitters upon her finger, set with a
gleaming green gemstone [silver ring with perfectly-
cut emerald; 1,050 gp]. [Total 5,050 gp]
60 You find a folded piece of soft wool with five
small compartments sewn into the center [2 sp].
In the first compartment is a finger-thick braided
gold chain with four coral bands and a circular
carved gold pendant with a piece of red coral
in the center [950 gp]. You also find a pair of
large matching coral and gold earrings there
[pair 250 gp]. The second compartment holds a
slender gold chain of some length with a square
silver pendant, its face framed and graced by latticework
of gold filigree. The frame and latticework
are sparkled with miniature copper-colored
crystal gems, whose fire brings the piece to life
[98 tiny yellow topaz; necklace 2,500 gp].
A third compartment contains a delicate silver
chain with a finger-length pendant. The
dainty pendant is open in the center, shaped
rather like an almond and has a faceted jet-black
almond-shaped jewel [onyx] at its base. The pendant’s
exterior has a vertical band of hematite
tracing its delicate lines [160 gp]. The fourth
compartment has a pair of silver hair combs with
moonstone ornamentation [550 gp each], and
the final compartment contains four coins [4
pp]. [Total 5,000.2 gp]
61 This room seems to be a storage area, full of bed
linens and pillows. These linens are not just runof-
the-mill items; they are made of soft smooth
silk in every color of the rainbow, with many different
patterns woven into the fabric. Every
sheet is large enough to cover the bed of a king,
and they are crafted with great expertise. The
pillows, also made from silk, are filled with down
and look comfortable for sitting or reclining. The
original owner of these items definitely liked to
sleep in comfort [22 pairs of bed sheets, 200 gp
each; 31 pillows, 22 gp each]. [Total 5,082 gp]
62 You find chainmail, bows, quivers, short swords,
packs and some other items. The chainmail consists
of four finely wrought coats which hang to
midthigh and have coifs to go over the head
[masterwork chainmail; 300 gp each]. There are
four composite longbows of very fine quality
[masterwork composite longbows; 400 gp each] and
as many ornate quivers decorated with a green
leafy-vine pattern, each containing 20 perfectly
balanced arrows [fancy quivers with 20 masterwork
arrows; 121 gp per quiver]. The four short
swords are in green leather scabbards with gold
leaf on them. The swords themselves are as finely
crafted as the rest of the equipment and have
hilts bound in green leather with gold leaf crossguards
and teardrop shaped pommels [masterwork
short swords and scabbards; 320 gp each].
Four shoulder bags [2 gp each] each contain a
leaf-wrapped package holding a week’s worth of
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
103
elven waybread which seems to still be fresh [5
gp] and a silver holy symbol of an elven deity
hanging by a braided green leather cord [25 gp
each]. Two of these packs contain daggers which
match the short swords and have similar scabbards
[12 gp each]. Beneath all these packs you
find a small pouch [1 gp] holding several gems:
ten pieces of blue stone [azurite, 10 gp each], a
beautiful red gem [red spinel, 100 gp], a black
stone [onyx, 50 gp], and a handful of coins [3 pp,
3 gp, 10 sp]. [Total 5,001 gp]
63 You find a wooden writing desk with layer upon
layer of dust on the surface; the wood has seen
better days and is mostly rotten in places [5 gp].
It is amazing this piece still stands forlornly in a
corner. The once pristine leather has been
reduced to a faded red, ripped and torn. The
wood is chipped and broken; the left side is
smashed beyond repair and there are marks like
tiny holes in the wooden panels, perhaps clues
to the source of the destruction. [A search of the
desk will reveal:] Despite its condition, the desk
still holds secrets. You find a wooden compartment
tucked safely away from prying eyes and
fingers; a small catch triggers the drawer and it
slides out only half way, sticking for a moment
before it opens fully and reveals a blue velvet
bag [1 gp]. It is about the size of a human fist,
with a white cord drawstring pulled tightly
closed and sealed with a wax seal. [The image
upon the seal is of a rearing horse or similar animal.]
In the bag you find five small gemstones, each
one perfectly cut into the shape of a diamond.
They are made from a purple stone, one that
gleams softly and is highly polished to a bright
sheen [5 rich purple corundums; 1,000 gp each].
[Total 5,006 gp]
64 You come across two paintings of a large silver
dragon, both of supremely fine quality. The first
depicts the dragon curled around a jutting outcrop
of rock against the backdrop of a stormladen
sky. The waves crash over the rock and
throw up in foamy sprays behind the creature
while lightning plays in the heavens above. The
painting has a carved wooden frame and upon
each corner of the frame is a shimmering pale
blue gemstone [aquamarine] held in a bas-relief
carving of a dragon’s face, the jaws open to hold
the jewel in place [painting and frame, 2,150 gp].
The second painting is of the same high quality
and features the dragon in full flight, this time
against the backdrop of summer. The dragon’s
wings are outstretched and the artist has captured
the light shining from the clouds in such a
way as to transform a simple image into a gorgeously
painted scene. Below the dragon is a
small town of red-tile rooftops and grey stone
buildings; a few towers rise upward towards the
heavens and behind the town the artist has
added a seascape. The frame is similar to that of
the first painting, except the bas-relief images
are of dragon claws holding the shimmering blue
stones [aquamarines; painting and frame, 2,150
gp]. Lastly upon the ground between the paintings
is a chalice [625 gp] made of polished wood
and carved with the image of the same dragon.
This time the creature’s tail loops around the
stem of the cup and its jaws hold a golden yellow
stone [topaz]. [Total 4,925 gp]
65 This sturdy trunk is bound shut with bands of
iron, and fastened with a strong lock [Amazing
lock; 155 gp]. Whoever closed the trunk intended
it to stay sealed. [Assuming the party is able to
open the trunk:] Inside the top of the trunk lies a
piece of unbleached wool [2 sp], covering the
rest of the contents. Below it is spread a net of
fine gold chain, with golden beads at each intersection
[net hair covering, shoulder length; 2,773
gp]. One end is narrower and rounded, and to its
tip is fastened a teardrop-shaped red gem [ruby].
Another piece of cloth [1 sp] wraps around a
golden girdle made of draping gold chains [137
gp]. From it dangle more than fifty gold coins.
Three sacks lie atop folded clothing. One bag [2
sp] clinks as you move it. Inside are dozens of
thin metal bracelets, silver, copper and bronze
bangles which would be worn in masses on the
wrists [bangles: 40 silver, 11 cp each; 40 copper, 4
cp each; 40 bronze, 3 cp each]. A small bag [1 sp]
holds a pair of short gold chains [anklets, 640 gp
each], from which dangle eight small red stones
[garnets]. Also in the sack are four slender gold
rings with red stones [garnets; 125 gp each]. In a
long slender linen bag you find an elegant silver
flute, untarnished and gleaming [masterwork,
125 gp]. Below the sacks are two outfits of clothing
[courtier’s outfits; 30 gp each]. One has a white
blouse, red vest and full black skirt; while the
other has an ivory blouse, black vest and green
skirt. Both blouses have collars and trim of lace,
while the vests and skirts sport elaborate
embroidery in a multitude of colors as well as silver
and gold. In the bottom of the trunk is a pair
of voluminous petticoats, multilayered and dripping
with lace. [Total 5,037.8 gp]
66 You see red cloth tossed over a box-like shape
and some other items. The fabric turns out to be
a fine red wool cloak with gold key-design trim
[10 gp] and a cleverly fashioned gold cloak pin
which looks like a hammer [135 gp]. Under the
cloak you find a locked box about the size of a
large backpack [Simple lock; box, 25 gp]. It is
the mother of all treasure tables
104
made of fine polished wood with a fancy
engraved silver-plated lock mechanism. The
box has two straps so that it can be worn on the
back and carried easily. There is also a superb
warhammer with a design gracing both haft and
hammer of a warrior in a chariot drawn by goats
with lightning emanating from his hammer
[masterwork, 315 gp] and beside it a coat of
chainmail with gilded links forming a hammer
pattern on the breast [300 gp]. Two more cloaks
of fine wool [one blue and one green, 8 gp each],
each have a knot-work pattern of silver and
black thread woven into the edge, accompanied
by silver and gold hammer-shaped cloak clasps
[85 gp each]. There are four belt pouches, all
empty [2 gp each], two long swords [15 gp each]
and a battle axe [10 gp]. When the box is opened
you find it holds a small golden shrine of a deity
with a warhammer. The image is crafted with
eyes of tiny sapphires [3,400 gp]. Inside a small
drawer in the base of the shrine is a small leather
bag [1 sp] with over two dozen coins [7 pp, 25 gp]
and five gems: two lavender, one pale green one
dark red and one golden brown [2 amethysts, 1
jade, 1 garnet, 1 amber; 100 gp each]. [Total
5,014.1 gp]
67 A crate and small barrel stand next to a small
pile of clothing and weapons. There is a
longsword, its hilt decorated with four claw-like
red stones [coral; longsword 450 gp], and two
thin, sharp daggers [2 gp each]. A blue wool cloak
[3 gp], small linen pants [2 sp] and two white
blankets [1 gp each] are jumbled under the
weapons. Below them are two gold goblets
wrapped in rags. Each goblet is decorated with a
large gem surrounded by three smaller ones. One
goblet has a large blue-green gem with small
purple stones; the other has a large clear yellow
gem with small green stones [goblet with aquamarine
and amethysts, 900 gp; goblet with golden topaz
and green spinels, 900 gp]. A third rag-wrapped
item is a lily of gold, large enough to fill your
palm, with four sparking red gems [red spinels] in
its center. The narrow well in the middle holds
a lingering scent of perfume. It has no pin and it
is not obvious how it was used [flower with gems,
1,200 gp]. A leather sack [1 gp] holds a book of
prayers [the deity of your choice, 5 gp], a silver holy
symbol [to the same deity] with four purple stones
[amethysts; holy symbol 430 gp], 5 cones of fine
incense [2 gp each] and a small gold saucer [5 gp]
for burning incense. A crate [1 gp] holds 30 bottles
of a famous red wine [10 gp each]. The small
barrel [1 gp] resting on the crate holds a potent,
fruity liquor [“Burning Forest” cherry brandy; 500
gp]. A black lacquered box [2 gp] contains coins
and gems [199 gp, 622 sp, 9,921 cp; 4 turquoise
and 8 malachite, 10 gp each]. [Total 5,194.61 gp]
68 An unsheathed sword lies by a cloth sack and a
metal box. Behind the sack sits a helmet. The
guard of the longsword is shaped like spread
wings; rising up from the hilt and curving
around the wielder’s hand as protection from
harm. The wings are a silvery white [platinum
plated] and stand out against the black leather of
the grip. The narrow blade is covered by runes
[perhaps invoking strength for the wielder and sharpness
for the blade] and was obviously made by a
master’s hand [masterwork; 365 gp]. The same
silvery wings are found on the nearby helmet,
swept up and back from about the wearer’s ears
[115 gp]. The helm has no nose or cheek protectors,
so it was probably worn on ceremonial
occasions.
The sturdy wool sack [2 gp] holds a soft bundle.
It is a folded cloak woven of the finest wool
and dyed a gorgeous purple. There is heavy silver
embroidery around the hem, somewhat tarnished
now. As you look closer, you see the
cloak is rather worn, though still usable [48 gp].
The metal box is a locked strongbox [Amazing
lock; masterwork box, 250 gp]. Inside are three
velvet pouches resting in a padding of unspun
white wool [2 cp]. The largest pouch, of blue velvet
[6 gp], lies flat and holds a platinum torc
which would fit a strong warrior [2,130 gp]. On
the front is the symbol of a pair of spread wings.
A small pouch of purple [3 gp] holds a platinum
ring, with spread wings supporting a deep purple
gem [purple corundum; 1,200 gp]. The smallest
pouch, also purple [2 gp], protects a similar platinum
ring. Wrought in a more delicate mold,
this time the wings hold a star sapphire [975 gp].
[Total 5,096.02 gp]
69 There is a deeply carved mahogany wardrobe [or
footlocker or chest, 150 gp] which when opened
reveals a rack of hanging clothes [a stack of
clothes folded], in apparently good condition,
smelling slightly of mothballs. Parting the clothing,
you find two gorgeous silk robes, one crimson
and one purple [150 gp each], long enough to
trail along the floor for all but the longest-legged
people. These robes are matching in style with
both front and back panels full of foreign characters
and icons ornately written, which suggest
the robes are used for ritual purposes. Next to
the purple robe are six plainer, white cotton garments,
suitable for wearing underneath it [6
inner robes, 30 gp each] — after all, it would not
do to contaminate a holy item with the profane
touch of human flesh! Next to these inner robes
are plain black leggings, again six in number [6
leggings, 2 gp each] of a nice, generous cut so as
not to be too revealing of the form within.
There is also a second, heavy, outer robe, this
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
105
one predominantly in black, with some vivid
flame-colored patches across the shoulders and a
definite suggestion of fires and smoke on the
back [outer robe, 85 gp]. Lastly, there is a crimson
chasuble [priestly outer garment] of crushed velvet
with floor-length tapestry panels woven in golden
thread hanging from each shoulder [250 gp].
In the bottom drawer of the wardrobe, are found
stacks of ritual linens ornamented with similar
characters and icons: folded and pressed altar
clothes [120 gp set], three heavily embroidered
stoles [10 gp each] and seven silken banners [10
gp each]. A small box [1 sp] containing a ring of
office with an extraordinarily large crimson
stone [star ruby, 1,950 gp] and a holy symbol set
with a similar stone and a golden chain [1,250
gp] are found. Looking for further treasures in
the back of the wardrobe, you discover two full
size thuribles, one gold and one silver. [Thuribles
are lantern-size containers which are strung on
arm’s length chains so that, when swung to and fro,
the burning incense inside is emitted into the body of
the temple. gold thurible, 500 gp; silver thurible, 50
gp]. Finally, the thuribles are resting on top of a
large box measuring a foot in each dimension
containing high quality incense [150 gp]. [Total
5,097 gp]
70 On the far side of the room is a loaded weapon’s
rack and a large barrel. The rack is full of items;
including a few swords, battle axes, tridents, a
number of suits of armor and shields. Up close,
you can take a more thorough inventory of the
items which rest here. The barrel [2 gp] holds a
collection of javelins, all recently made and sturdy
[40 javelins, 1 gp each]. The weapon’s rack [10
gp] is well made and durable with room for
dozens of weapons and suits of armor. Most predominant
are the eight suits of scale mail [8 suits
masterwork scale mail, 200 gp each], recently
cleaned, oiled and in perfect condition. Not a
single suit looks as if it has been worn in battle.
Resting on hooks are eight heavy steel shields,
all with the same insignia [either random or relevant
to the game world; four normal shields, 20 gp
each; four masterwork shields, 170 gp each]. A row
of four gleaming longswords stands at attention,
each one in a worked leather scabbard [4
longswords, 15 gp each]. Nearby is a pair of gleaming
battle axes [2 battle axes, 10 gp each]. The row
of weapons ends with two tridents, one of which
looks to be finely crafted [one normal trident, 15
gp; one masterwork trident, 315 gp]. Along the top
is a carefully arrayed row of daggers [16 daggers,
2 gp each], and a spyglass [1000 gp] in perfect condition.
Under the rack is a locked metal strongbox
[Good lock; strongbox, 83 gp]. Apparently,
this was a paymaster’s box; it is filled with coin
[1000 gp, 675 sp]. [Total 5,004.5 gp]
71 A marble statue [500 gp] the size of an average
human male stands guard here, looking as if it
will come to life at the slightest touch. Holding
a rapier in its right hand and a dagger in its left
makes it seem poised to strike. The statue wears
a suit of plate armor. As you near it, you can see
the weapons and armor are gilded and bedecked
with a number of small gemstones. All of the
the mother of all treasure tables
106
items are purely ornamental; the weapons are
poorly weighted and blunt, and the armor seems
to be merely in the shape of a breastplate without
offering any real protection. Still, as ornamental
or ceremonial items, these are beautiful.
The dagger blade is made of a single deep blue
stone [iolite], and similar stones are set into the
handle [dagger, 300 gp]. The rapier has a steel
blade, but the pommel is encrusted with the
same blue stones. In fact, you cannot see any
steel on the entire sword except for the blade
[rapier 800 gp]. The armor is similarly ceremonial
in appearance, and is dotted with many
stones, mostly clear and in various shapes and
sizes [rock crystal; armor 3,000 gp]. The stones
are arranged into a pattern of a man riding a
horse and carrying a lance, charging a huge
dragon. The statue also wears a worn leather
belt [5 sp] from which hang two large sacks [1 sp
each]. These are loaded with gold coins [200 gp
each]. Age and wear have worn off most of the
markings on the coins. [Total 5,000.7 gp]
72 A large silk screen the height of a man and the
same breadth hangs stretched on a delicate
wooden frame at one side of the room [silk
screen, 2,000 gp]. The screen is painted with a
beautiful rendition of life in the four seasons.
The upper left quadrant shows the early shoots
of spring on a mountainside as a waterfall splashes
into a river nearby and herons circle overhead.
The river runs into the upper right quadrant,
which portrays the lazy days of summer.
Two lovers bask in the sunshine next to an elegant
picnic spread while their horses graze in the
background. The lower right quadrant depicts
autumn, when rich golden browns bedeck the
trees and the harvest has yielded many good
things for the table. Finally, the lower left quadrant
shows a snow-covered wintry scene, where
a few forlorn, black birds peck in the ground
looking for food and the icy waters of the river
seek to cleanse themselves of all memories of
human activity. Behind the screen is a small,
plain wooden footstool [1 gp] on which rest six
vellum [calf-skin] scrolls tied together with red
silk. Curious, you unwrap the scrolls and find
each one is a delightful piece of art in its own
right [6 artworks on vellum, 500 gp each], with
delicate paintings and subtle but sophisticated
calligraphy, depicting six creatures of good fortune
and their habits and habitat: the unicorn,
the rabbit, the dove, the turtle, the dragon and
the elephant. [Total 5,001 gp]
73 You find piles of clothing strewn on and around
two large chests [5 gp each], one of which is
open. There is a mixture of outfits, everything
from holy vestments and noblemen’s clothing to
peasant’s garb. [An inventory yields the following
outfits: 1 set cleric’s vestments, 5 gp; 1 monk’s outfit,
5 gp; 3 courtier’s outfits, 30 gp each; 3 entertainer’s
outfits, 3 gp each; 1 explorer’s outfit, 10 gp;
1 noble’s outfit, 75 gp; 1 royal outfit, 200 gp; 3
scholar’s outfits, 5 gp each; 3 peasant’s outfits, 1 sp
each.] All the clothing is sized to fit a man of
medium stature. Under the clothes, in the bottom
of the open chest, is a woolen blanket [5 sp]
wrapped around two large silver holy symbols
[25 gp each], three paper fans [2 sp each], a fake
spyglass [1 sp], and a blank book [play prop or a
stolen spellbook, 15 gp].
The second chest is bound shut. Its heavily
padded interior holds an array of high-quality
musical instruments, enough to outfit a minstrel
troupe: three lutes, three mandolins, five
recorders with various tones, two pan pipes, two
cymbals of different sizes, with padded mallets
and wooden stands from which they hang, and
three drums [18 instruments, 100 gp each]. Some
of the padding seems to be missing in one corner
and you feel hard lumps in that area. [If the
adventurers investigate, they find items hidden in the
lining:] Inside the lining are two leather pouches
[2 sp each] and a painted box [2 sp], which holds
seven rings [some fake, some authentic and perhaps
stolen]. Four are silvery rings with gems, two
shiny and two slightly duller. One shiny ring has
a black pearl and the other a blue-grey gem
[aquamarine; two platinum rings with gems, 750 gp
each], while the more muted ones both have
large red stones [pewter rings with red glass, 5 sp
each]. There are also two signet rings [both fake;
5 gp each] and a gold ring with a navy blue gem
[spinel; 550 gp]. Each pouch contains many coins
[18 pp, 147 gp, 151 sp, 86 cp; 12 pp, 153 gp, 129
sp, 114 cp]. [Total 4,977.1 gp]
74 You find a single longsword which just speaks of
superior craftsmanship. The blade is elegantly
made and plated with a layer of silver, polished
nearly to a mirror-bright sheen and kept in perfect
condition [silver-plated masterwork
longsword, 5,050 gp]. There are several features
which mark this weapon as a cut above the rest.
The blade itself has a fine tracery of vine-leaf
patterns upon the surface trailing and winding
down toward the guard, where a small green leaf
is set behind a circle of crystal. The guard is a
flowing design akin to a tree; with symmetrical
branches reproduced in darker silver and curling
upwards, this piece seems more decorative than
protective. Small painted leaves have been
added to the tree to further enhance the guard’s
design. A sturdy hilt attaches to the guard and
flows smoothly downwards covered in good
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
107
quality dark red leather; this too has been covered
in a tracery of vine and leaf patterns,
stitched into the material with silver thread.
The pommel is a silver-plated hemisphere covered
with small branch-like designs. Set into
this hemisphere is a pale, misty blue gemstone
[sapphire] completing the weapon. The stone has
been carefully cut and shaped with a myriad of
tiny facets, each one gleaming with the reflection
of the onlooker. [The pommel can be
unscrewed to reveal a secret compartment, big
enough to store a vial or a small rolled parchment
message — a hard task check or skill resolution
based on some kind of perception will reveal this feature.]
[Total 5,035 gp]
75 Here you see a four-legged round wooden stand,
about hip high, its legs and sides decorated with
elaborate carvings [56 gp]. On its top sit two
boxes, one of silver and one covered with fabric.
On the floor below the stand lies a long roll of
some sort of cloth, in blue and yellow. The
rolled bundle proves to be a trio of rectangular,
braided rugs, in three different patterns of blue
and yellow [2 gp each]. Each rug is large enough
for a tall man to lie on with outstretched arms.
On the table, a small casket of silver is covered
with a swirling pattern of engraved lines.
[The pattern is actually a maze which runs from one
corner all the way around the box.] It has a silver
hinge and a good lock [Good lock; 165 gp]. The
interior of the hinged lid holds a silver mirror,
and the base has compartments lined with pale
gray velvet. Inside the silver box is a coiled belt
totally covered with tiny beads, in wide strips of
dark blue, turquoise, yellow-green and black
[132 gp]. It is made of some flexible material and
is long enough to simply knot around a woman’s
waist. Below this lies a slender gold chain, from
which hangs a teardrop-shaped pendant of pink
mother of pearl [139 gp]. The interior of the
pendant is open, and in the area dangles a cluster
of tiny freshwater pearls and peridots.
Next to the silver casket is a square box a
handspan in two dimensions and half that deep,
covered with spring-green tapestry fabric [42 gp].
In the tapestry box is a long silver chain holding
an oval of glossy black [onyx] in a silver setting
[760 gp]. The pendant is as long as a lady’s
thumb, with its center about as wide as that
same thumb. It is very simple, yet sophisticated.
The box also holds a necklace about two
handspans long of polished jade beads, with
larger beads at the center and smaller ones making
up the length of the necklace [3,420 gp].
Finally in the box is a small pouch of pale blue
silk [3 gp] filled with glittering platinum coins
[20 pp]. [Total 4,923 gp]
76 A sturdy chest [2 gp] holds an exquisite brass
statuette of a horse, a handspan long, which also
stands a handspan high on its marble base [68
gp]. Its head dipped to one side, the horse stands
saddled and bridled, ready to ride. Beside this
lies an empty bullseye lantern [12 gp] with four
flasks of oil [4 sp]. Wrapped in scraps of cloth are
half a dozen delicate silver vases, each significantly
less than a handspan tall. Although each
is different in style, all six are of quality workmanship
[9 gp each]. Also tucked in is a silver
serving utensil shaped like a birch leaf, with a
twisting stem as the handle [17 gp]. One vase
contains a small rolled piece of blue silk [2 sp]
which holds a silver pin. It is roughly circular,
made of five ribbon-like pieces which join at the
center. Numerous colorful stones fleck the
streamers, in green, dark red, orange, gold and
deep purple [5 each green spinel, red garnet, coral,
topaz, violet garnet; pin, 1338 gp]. At the bottom
of the chest lies a flat steel box with a sturdy
lock [Good lock; box, 90 gp]. It is fairly heavy [22
pounds]. Inside the box are four small leather
pouches [1 gp each]. Three are quite plump, each
holding a different type of coin [295 gp, 295 sp,
295 cp]. The fourth holds a beautiful piece of
pale green jade, faceted and shaped like a slightly
tapered rectangle, which hangs by a silver link
from a braided silk cord nearly the same color as
the stone [3,090 gp]. [Total 5,004.25 gp]
77 [Depending on the location, the following can either
be in good condition with living toads or else be a
relic of the past, with the little bodies of the toads
having mummified through lack of air.] This is [or,
was] a toad-fancier’s paradise. A large wooden
case with glass windows stands proudly to one
side of the room. Inside are many toads, in a
variety of colors and warty, knobbled textures,
more than three dozen in all [40 toads, 3 sp each].
There are seven small marble houses and halls
for the toads to play, each one a lovingly made
scale model of an original building somewhere
[290 gp each], together with a small forest of
twisted miniature trees made from silk and carnelian
chips [20 trees, 62 gp each]. Four handbooks
on toad care rest on top of the wooden
and glass case, each providing in extraordinary
detail how to care for the little fellows, cater for
their diets and every whim [4 books, 30 gp each],
while the case itself would be sought after by
many, if it proved possible to extract it [toad case
600 gp]. There are two elegant toad-handler
rods, as long as a man’s arm and made from ivory
with fine fabric nets attached to the end [80 gp
each]. On a wooden shelf above the case is a row
of four pewter toads, each about the size of a
woman’s fist [54 gp each], together with a crystal
the mother of all treasure tables
108
plaque etched with the likeness of a toad [125
gp] and a small canvas bag [2 sp] with a batrachian
[i.e. toad-like] design on the side and containing
three egg-shaped pieces of crystal with
tiny toads embedded in their centers [167 gp
each]. [Total 5,004.2 gp].
78 Many objects are strewn about here. Some are
whole while others are damaged, and there are
numerous loose coins. Among these items are a
winter blanket [5 sp], a backpack [2 gp] holding
an ivory scroll case with a star ruby on the lid
and an image of a sunburst adorning the side
[1,050 gp], a small silver mirror [30 gp], and a
single set of cleric’s robes [5 gp]. Tucked inside
the scroll case you find three silver holy symbols
[bearing the same sunburst as the case; 25 gp each].
Next to the backpack, fully laid out, is an
exquisite suit of full plate armor. Platinum sunbursts
cover the shoulders, prayers for protection
are written with gold into the chest piece, and a
noble crest adorns the helm. It all gleams as if it
has just been polished [masterwork; 2,450
gp]. Near the armor is an equally well made
warhammer; although less ornamental, its
craftsmanship is beyond compare [masterwork;
312 gp].
Nearby, under two sets of worn but usable
leather armor [10 gp each], is another holy symbol,
smashed and bent beyond use but possibly
still of some value for the metal [5 gp]. Inside a
slashed backpack you find a heavy tome
wrapped in linen. Though written in a language
foreign to you it may have value to certain collectors
[rare religious book; 300 gp]. The coins
which litter the floor, when collected, make a
sizeable pile [32 pp, 380 gp, 460 sp, 450 cp].
[Total 5,000 gp]
79 You find a heavy canvas bag stained brown in
spots and strained by the weight of its contents
[1 sp]. Its seams appear close to bursting. Inside
the bag, an oiled and water-resistant leather sack
[2 sp] tied with a leather cord rests upon a large
store of coins [32 pp, 74 gp, 1,060 sp]. In the sack
you find two platinum wristlets etched with an
interlocking diamond chain pattern and decorated
with eight small gems of deepest purple
[alexandrite; wristlets 1,500 gp each] and five
stones of a warm green color each larger than
your thumbnail [jade; 300 gp each]. [Total
5,000.3 gp]
80 Built into the wall of the room is a cabinet
which stretches from floor to ceiling. The top
half of each tall wooden door contains yellow
and green stained glass windows [2 stained glass
windows, 100 gp each]. You can make out the
outline of three shelves holding objects.
Opening the doors, you can better see the items
as well as revealing a cupboard on the bottom,
below the windows. The top shelf holds a
ceramic bowl and pitcher, ivory colored with
yellow flowers stenciled around the rims [washbasin
and pitcher set, 15 gp] and a silver brooch in
the shape of a sunflower [brooch, 25 gp]. The
central shelf has a hardened clay tea set in the
center: a teapot, four cups, and a tray [tea set, 10
gp] and a beautiful wide-mouthed crystal vase
[20 gp] holding a bouquet of silk flowers [bouquet
5 gp]. The third shelf is home to a cedar jewelry
box containing three rings, one with a reddish
stone [bloodstone] set in gold [70 gp], two with
purple stones [amethysts], also set in gold
[matched rings, 200 gp each], and five pairs of earrings
in silver, all with green stones [jade], each
cut in a different shape: round, cylindrical,
cubic, star-shaped, and irregular [5 pairs of earrings,
200 gp each]. On the shelf in the cabinet
below is a brass spittoon [5 gp] holding coins
[102 pp, 397 gp, 712 sp]. Lying nearby is a
repeating heavy crossbow [masterwork repeating
crossbow, 700 gp] with a case of 20 bolts [set of 20
bolts, 2 gp]. Below them, on the floor in a coil,
are a spiked chain [masterwork spiked chain, 325
gp] and a suit of half-plate armor [masterwork
half-plate armor, 750 gp]. [Total 5,015.2 gp]
81 Resting at your feet is a white oak box [275 gp],
masterfully made, encircled with silver banding
and its top inlaid with ivory. It is closed by a small
golden clasp. Opening it you discover the softest
of wool lining its interior, and wool-wrapped
wooden spacers creating slotted openings varying
in depth. This case is configured to hold a dozen
flat objects standing on end and contains twelve
finely detailed plaques depicting religious figures.
There are three each of four types of plaques: flat
sculpted bronze images on cedar wood bases [three
plaques, 35 gp each], plaques of religious iconography
with rope-like golden frames [three plaques,
500 gp each], painted rosewood triptychs with
golden hinges and clasps [three plaques, 300 gp
each] and three plaques of solid gold [750 gp each].
[Total 5,030 gp]
82 In the center of the room stands a magnificent
statue of a golden dragon [4,950 gp]. The statue
stands four feet tall and is crafted with such
exacting detail it almost looks alive. The dragon
appears to be made of solid gold and you imagine
it maybe worth tens of thousands of gold
pieces. [The dragon is not actually made of pure
gold, but instead is gold-plated — two inches of gold
plating over wood. It is still quite an impressive statue.]
It is quite heavy and may be difficult to get
to a safe place [weighs 200 pounds]. The dragon’s
table VI: 5,000 gold pieces
109
mouth is open as if it is about the belch out a
blast of deadly flame, and its tail is wrapped
around it in a defensive looking posture. [Total
4,950 gp]
83 At first it looks as if a large log has been left
lying on the floor, but a moment of investigation
reveals in fact two dugout canoes [25 gp each]
have been lashed together with several lengths
of stout rope [hempen rope, 50 feet; 1 gp].
Removing a couple of the ropes and sliding the
top canoe off reveals piles of treasure. The first
thing to grab the attention is a large bolt of silk
with large patterns woven with gold thread at
each end; unwrapped, it is perhaps twenty paces
in length and one in breadth [20 yards; 50 gp
each]. Lifting this reveals a pile of sparkling golden
rocks, seventeen in all ranging in size from an
eyeball to a fist. [The rocks are only fool’s gold but
make for attractive objects nonetheless, and would
be useful for con artists. 300 gp total]. In the center
of the lower canoe is a small crate [1 gp]
packed tightly with precious and exotic cloves
[16 pounds, 15 gp each] and a cubical mahogany
box the size of a man’s hand in all dimensions [2
gp] which, when opened, is found to be full of
fine frankincense [250 gp]. At the other end of
the canoe is a pile of eight sacks, loosely bound
at the openings, which each contain a variety of
highly polished and preserved tortoise shells
varying in size and color [136 tortoise shells, average
25 gp each]. [Total 5,244 gp]
84 The tang of salt wafts through the air, along
with a whiff of iron. A small wooden table [2 gp]
catches your eye. Sitting on it is a chalice of a
gleaming, silvery metal [platinum chalice, 700 gp]
containing rusty brown residue. A small wooden
chest [1 gp] lies next to the table. It stands open
and reveals a number of silvery coins [150 pp].
Also next to the small table is a long shallow
box being supported by two portable anvils [40
gp each]. The box is rather plain, with a hinged
lid, and is made of pine with dimensions large
enough to contain an average human [coffin, 10
gp]. On the far wall is a glass cabinet [400 gp]
filled with various religious symbols and wooden
stakes [14 stakes, 3 cp each]. Each symbol is made
of silver and set with a single gem [9 silver symbols
with jade, amber, jet, green spinel, red spinel,
white pearl, tourmaline, amethyst, garnet; 200 gp
each]. Lined silken drapes darken the windows
[or: line the walls]. [10 drapes, 6 square yards
apiece; 60 gp each]. [Total 5,093.42]
85 Three weapons lie in the center of this room: a
battle axe, a warhammer, and a scimitar. They
are placed to form a rough triangle in the center
of which lies a single platinum coin. [This portion
of the floor may be trapped in some way if desired.]
The weapons look like very high quality items.
Examine the scimitar you can feel the balance
and see the fine craftsmanship [masterwork scimitar,
315 gp]. The warhammer shows the same
fine balance and exemplary construction [masterwork
warhammer, 312 gp]. Finally you pick up
the battle axe and, as you expected, it has been
forged with the same quality as the other two
weapons [masterwork battle axe, 310 gp]. When
you finally pick up the platinum coin which was
resting in the center of the triangle created by
the weapons, a small section of cobblestone
begins to sink into the ground, and within seconds
is no longer visible. [If someone reaches their
hand into the hole created by the sinking floor stone:]
You reach your hand into the recess within the
floor and feel many pieces of metal; you hear it
clinking as you move your hand around.
Grasping the metal and retrieving your hand
from the hole, you find it full of platinum coins.
You have to dip your hand into the hole several
times before you retrieve them all, but when you
are sure you have cleared out the gap in the floor
you have uncovered 400 platinum coins [400
pp]. [Total 4,937 gp]
86 This room is filled with wooden barrels, sitting
or lying about. Most of them seem to be open so
it will be easy to investigate their contents.
There are over twenty barrels, but many of them
look empty from here [23 barrels, 2 gp each; 13
are empty]. As you examine the contents of the
barrels, you get the feeling this is a storage area
for unwanted items. Eight barrels contain clothing.
There are dresses and skirts, pantaloons and
shirts, mixed in with stockings, scarves, wool
caps and cloaks. They are in good condition for
used clothes, but probably are not worth very
much compared to their bulk [105 traveler’s outfits,
without boots; 8 sp each]. You spot a barrel in
the center of the area which appears to be full of
coins, so you make your way over to it. You find
the barrel is indeed full of coins — copper coins.
There must be thousands of them [52,495 cp;
weight 1,050 pounds]. Someone seems to have
abandoned them here, evidently not considering
the coins worth the effort of transporting
them. Another barrel contains small bottles
with cork stoppers. There are twenty-two bottles
stacked haphazardly in the barrel and you can
tell there used to be more, but several have broken.
Each bottle is simply marked “beer” [twenty-
two bottles of beer, 1 sp each — mostly for the
bottles]. [If the adventurers are alert, they will
notice:] As you step close to the next barrel your
footfall makes a hollow sound. The barrel is
empty so it is easy to move aside, and when you
the mother of all treasure tables
110
do you find a small pull-ring set into the floor.
There is a removable section here, less than two
feet square. When you lift the piece you find a
hidden space with a sealed wooden chest [2 gp].
It takes some effort to lift it out from its hiding
place. [The chest weighs nearly 90 pounds.] Inside
it you discover a small round steel buckler which
looks as if it was forged by a master craftsman
[masterwork, 165 gp] sitting atop a pile of gold
coins [4,190 gp]. [Total 5,014.15 gp]
87 There is a spyglass on a tripod gracing the room.
A rare find indeed, the spyglass is about four feet
long and rests on a five-foot-tall tripod. To a
stargazer or inquisitive scholar this item is a true
treasure [2,200 gp]. There are several more items
nearby on a large desk. The first is a pair of
round-rimmed glasses [250 gp]. Should you try
them on, you would immediately notice they
magnify everything quite a bit. The spectacles
would make a great tool for reading small text,
or for someone with failing eyesight. Lying
beside the glasses is a golden sextant. This
instrument, used for navigating, is truly a beautifully
crafted item [300 gp]. The last item sitting
on the table is a map of the entire region. But
the map is not as interesting as the frame which
holds it. The frame is made of pure platinum and
has stars etched into it. [The map represents a 250
square mile area of the immediate region in which
the adventurers are. The GM should decide how
detailed and how accurate the map is. The frame is
a foot square and weighs 4 pounds; map, 25 gp;
frame, 220 pp.] [Total 4,975 gp]
88 An odd shape stands before you; a creature as
tall as a horse and much more massive made
from a grey highly polished stone [polished granite
elephant, 1,100 gp]. It is a strange creature
with a large solid body and huge flap-like ears,
tiny beady eyes, a small tail, a slender elongated
snout and four stumpy legs. The shape is covered
from head to tail in ornate fine-filigree gold and
silver wire, which makes up a headdress and
covering for the back of the statue [headdress 200
gp]. The centerpiece on the forehead of the statue
is an elaborate diamond-shaped silver piece
which seems to be separate from the headdress
itself. It is decorated with five gems in a diamond
pattern. The four outer gems are fiery
orange in color and each cut in a diamond shape
[topaz] with the points not quite touching the
center piece. It is a glittering blood-red gem
with a white star at its heart [star ruby], set in the
center of an intricate silver flower design [forehead
piece, 3,650 gp]. Around the statue’s legs are
silver clasps [4 silver clasps, 20 gp each]; each one
is carved with intricate motifs and scenes. One
seems to be scenes of a battle, another of a coronation,
a third recalls a time of peace and the
final one appears to be a funeral procession.
Small silver chains hang from the back of each
one of these anklets and barely touch the
ground; they do not attach to anything. [On
closer inspection each chain ends in a broken link;
this could indicate the item was stolen from somewhere
else and transported here.] [Total 5,030 gp]
89 Your attention is drawn to the back of the room
— to a large statue of a man in flowing robes. It
is carved from marble and is impressively
detailed [400 gp]. The man is sculpted with long
hair flowing down his back, and with high
pointy ears. His eyes are clear with a piercing
gaze. They are bright green and of wide rounded
emeralds set into the marble [2 emeralds, 1,850
gp each]. The man’s hands are outstretched and
in each one rests a small white opal [500 gp each].
The opals are easily removed from their resting
place. [The emeralds are more difficult to remove
intact.] Even searching the rest of the room, you
find nothing else of worth. [Total 5,100 gp]
90 You come across a pile of coins of various
denominations, shapes and sizes [28 pp, 370 gp,
3,500 sp] which were once held in small sacks;
these have burst their seams from the passage of
time as this gaudy treasure has lain undisturbed.
The sacks are now useless and parts of them
have rotted away, leaving nothing but threads
and patches of moldy material. The coins bear
marks showing they are not all from the same
locale; some have the heads of old monarchs
while others have been minted with images of
wolves and other creatures. Poking up through
the pile of shining coins is a small silver statue of
a bird which holds in its talons a single deep
blue gemstone with a white star-form gleaming
in its center [star sapphire]. [The bird is similar to
an Egyptian ibis. If that is not appropriate, substitute
any bird of prey, such as a hawk or a falcon;
statue 1,200 gp.] Also obscured by the coins is a
long golden scepter [about one and a half forearms-
length] inscribed with angular writing and
set with a large polished crystal head in the
shape of a finger-length non-human skull [an
elven skull made from a smoky quartz] with eyes
formed from round, highly reflective black
stones [black pearls; scepter 2,800 gp]. A few letters
of the same angular writing are found again
upon the skull. [This writing may form part of a
larger puzzle or could be meaningless gibberish or
clever vandalism/graffiti.] [Total 5,000 gp]
91 Here lie three canvas bags, two smaller [2 sp
each] and one larger [1 gp], each tied with a
leather cord. In one of the small bags is a necktable
VI: 5,000 gold pieces
111
lace with six intertwining strands of tiny coral
beads, wrapped with a twisted copper wire to
hold their shape [1,200 gp]. At the center front
is fastened a copper ornament in the shape of an
exotic flower. Its bloom is enameled red, while
the stamen and leaf are burnished copper.
Matching it are earrings, copper hoops with
dangling flowers also enameled red with coral
stamens [pair, 150 gp]. There is also a bracelet
made from eight ovals of polished wood, smooth
and flat on the inside but rounded on the outer
surface and gleaming almost like gems. The
color and grain of each shining piece is unique
ranging, from nearly black to pale tan. They are
attached by pieces of brass, with a brass fastener
[55 gp]. Additionally, there are loose stones: two
square blue-green stones [aquamarines; 800 gp
each], six pieces of clear gold [amber; 90 gp each]
and ten small, very pale blue crystals [9 blue
quartz, 6 gp each; 1 blue diamond, 1,000 gp]. The
other small bag holds gold coins [250 gp] while
the larger one contains silver [550 sp]. [Total
4,905.4 gp]
92 A box [1 gp] contains two finely woven black
wool robes. One is plain; the other, although
apparently identical, has many interior pockets
[robe without pockets, 4 gp; robe with interior pockets,
8 gp]. A greataxe [20 gp] with a rag-wrapped
blade lies next to a composite longbow of yew
and a quiver of 20 arrows [1 gp] fletched in white
goose feathers. The yew bow is for a tall person
with a strong pull [composite longbow, +2 Strength
bonus, 300 gp]. A small shoulder pack [2 gp] has
a compartment with a small fat book and many
little built-in pockets. The tattered, leatherbound
book looks like a spellbook, but has only
two pages with writing; the script looks like gibberish:
squares, circles and squiggly lines [blank
spellbook, 15 gp]. The pockets hold small spell
components: cobweb, bits of dirt, powdered
gems, etc. Wedged into the book’s spine is a
small emerald [500 gp]. Three small red garnets
[50 gp each] are sewn into the lining of the
pouch. A gold pitcher with figures of dancers
lies beside the pack [pitcher, 400 gp]. In the pack
you find a tiny, jeweled silver box decorated
with five small yellow-green stones [box with
crysoberyls, 500 gp], two jeweled rings, and many
coins [90 gp, 591 sp, 844 cp]. The box contains
expensive snuff [snuff, 20 gp]. One of the rings is
silver, made for a small finger and set with four
violet gems [violet garnets; ring 2,200 gp]; the
other is large, gold, and set with a single very
fine blue stone [blue spinel; ring 800 gp]. [Total
5,013.54 gp]
93 You have entered a room with very interesting
decor. In each corner there is an unpainted,
white porcelain statue of an animal. They are all
different. In the first corner stands a large grizzly
bear [total weight 1573 lbs; 82 gp]. A mountain
lion [total weight 308 lbs; 56 gp] is growling in the
second corner. The third corner holds a housecat
[total weight 31 lbs; 28 gp] preening itself. A
large rat [total weight 2 lbs; 17 gp] lurks in the
fourth corner. There are tapestries on every wall
and each one has a scene corresponding to a
nearby statue [4 tapestries with metallic thread,
350 gp each]. There is a scene of a copper colored
grizzly bear attacking a group of humanoids; a
tapestry depicting a silver mountain lion standing
on the ledge of a mountain looking for prey;
a view of a golden housecat rubbing up against
its master’s leg; and a tapestry portraying a platinum
colored rat running through a wet, mucky
sewer. [Three of the statues are unusual for their
material and size, because they are filled with coins:
the bear holds 76,350 cp, the mountain lion 13,980
sp, and the house cat 1,295 gp. The rat is hollow
and empty]. [Total 5,039.5 gp]
94 A big canvas sack [2 sp], a large bundle wrapped
in some type of skin, and an old, oversized backpack
are found. The large canvas bag holds
bulky pieces of armor, proving to be a suit of
glossy black banded mail for a person significantly
larger than a human warrior [sized for an
ogre or half-ogre]. It is of unusual make, appearing
as if it is made of many individual pieces, slightly
rounded, almost like large scales [black dragonhide
armor; 1,300 gp].
Beneath the sack are two weapons: a bastard
sword in a battered leather sheath and a heavy
spiked chain [25 gp]. The sword is black iron
with strong spikes around the top of the blade as
the guard [masterwork, cold iron; 670 gp]. You
unfold the other bundle to discover it is a huge
fur cloak of excellent quality, made of wolf pelts
[150 gp]. It is large enough that on a tall man it
would still drag a foot on the ground. Wrapped
up in the cloak you find a repeating heavy crossbow
[400 gp].
The backpack is much larger than average,
made of heavy leather, now very worn [4 gp]. In
the top of it is a leather pouch which holds what
feels like a rock [a piece of rock salt, 0.8 pound; 4
gp]. Below it is a tattered linen shirt, much
stained and little washed but much larger than
would fit a strong man [1 sp]. The shirt is
wrapped around something else hard. It proves
to be a torc, made of intertwined strands of gold
and silver, but of a size which would fit around
the waist of a slender elf [or the neck of an ogre;
340 gp].
the mother of all treasure tables
112
In the bottom of the backpack is a wool sack
which must have once been white [2 gp]. Inside
it is a small box of pale golden wood, slightly
nicked but still retaining its gloss [3 gp]. The box
contains a bag of pale lavender silk, embroidered
with flowers in shades of darker purple [6 gp].
Inside the bag is a square-linked double chain of
silver, which holds a large, teardrop-shaped
amethyst in a wide silver setting. The purple
stone is as long as a man’s thumb joint and carefully
faceted so it catches and reflects the light
[2,085 gp]. [Total 4,989.3 gp]
95 A strange sight greets your eyes: a barrel
wrapped in chains is suspended from a rope run
through a block and tackle. The rope [50 feet silk
rope, 10 gp] unties easily enough, and with a little
effort you can lower the barrel to the ground.
The chain [30 feet, 90 gp] is longer than it looks,
and is simply looped around both ends of the
barrel. Now unwrapped, the barrel [2 gp] looks to
be in good shape. [Note: If the characters can find
a way to get to the block and tackle, it is worth 5 gp.]
You can pry off the lid easily to reveal the contents.
Poking out from the pile is the hilt of a
rapier with a gleaming purple stone mounted in
it [violet garnet; rapier, 520 gp]. On top is a hand
crossbow in perfect working condition [masterwork
crossbow, 400 gp] and a case containing 20
bolts [2 gp]. Below the crossbow is a spell component
pouch [5 gp] which contains not typical
components, but 15 flawless white pearls [100 gp
each]. Also in the pouch is a set of thieves’ tools
[masterwork tools, 100 gp]. These items sit on top
of a large case which opens to reveal a complete
alchemist’s lab [500 gp]. The only item out of
place in the case is a large, golden statuette that
is disturbing if looked at closely [gold holy symbol
to a god of destruction, 250 gp]. Three flasks of
acid [10 gp each] and three copper and iolite
bracelets [100 gp each] sit in the mess of coins at
the bottom of the barrel [85 pp, 317 gp, 845 sp,
1,141 cp]. [Total 4,976.91 gp]
96 A very large sack [3 sp] contains a large silver
bowl [20 gp], a small gold statue of a tall slender
woman [perhaps a local deity; 100 gp] and a bright
red skirt with small brass circles hanging around
the bottom [8 sp]. The red skirt jingles as you
move it. Below it, a large piece of black velvet
has painted designs in silver, some of which you
recognize as religious. There are small pieces of
mica on it causing the cloth to reflect light [175
gp]. Also in the sack is a piece of wood about an
arm’s-length on each side, covered with a scene
of people climbing a mountain, done in gold
leaf, silver leaf, and paint [a decorative screen
from a temple, 15 gp]. You also find a bracelet of
brightly polished copper links [8 sp], a ring, and
a white gown. The ring is gold with a large red
stone [star ruby; ring 2,200 gp]. The gown, for a
tall well built woman, is white silk set with tiny
crystals [rock crystals; dress 2,200 gp]. It sparkles
as you move it. Also in the sack is a dagger with
rags wrapped loosely about its blade, its handle
decorated with alternating black and white
stones [hematite and freshwater pearls; dagger 102
gp] and a tambourine with shiny bright tin disks
on the dangling silver fringe [5 gp]. At the bottom
of the sack are copper and gold coins,
including some from distant lands and peculiar
gold pieces with holes in the middle [187 gp, 310
cp]. [Total 5,009 gp]
97 A gigantic skull rests in the middle of the room.
It appears too large to be real. As you near it,
you catch a glint from one of the huge front
teeth. Upon closer examination, you find, it is a
real skull [skull of a fire or stone giant, 50 gp] and
the glint from the tooth is actually a diamond
set there [1,000 gp]. A little examining shows
the skull has been turned into a treasure chest.
The top of the skull is hinged in back, and
secured in the front with a small brass clasp. The
skull brainpan houses a mass of gold and silver
coins in roughly equal amounts [672 gp, 504 sp].
Through the nose, you see another glint of more
silver. Opening the jaw reveals a deep silver
chalice lying on its side [250 gp], filled with a
wadded woolen cloth [1 gp]. When the cloth is
unfolded, you discover several items of jewelry.
A very nice platinum comb set with coral is
present [300 gp], as is a gold bracelet with three
green stones [spinels; bracelet, 500 gp]. You also
find a wide gold ring set with a gleaming red and
white gem [fire opal ring, 1,250 gp] and another
ring bearing four small blue-green stones [aquamarine
ring, 700 gp]. Finally, sitting in the bottom
of the cup is a twined gold bracelet made of
dozens of strands of golden wire woven together
[300 gp]. [Total 5,073.4 gp]
98 There is a pile of old sacks and bags in one corner
which do not look particularly interesting at
first sight. The top two are empty [2 sacks, 1 sp
each]. Under those are three sacks full of raw
wool [3 sacks, 1 sp each; raw wool, 2 sp per bag],
but poking through the pile finally reveals one
sack [1 sp] containing a number of lumpy items,
which turn out to be wooden boxes. There are
five total and they are each about two
handspans long and one span wide and deep [5
wooden boxes, 1 gp each]. The boxes may be
opened by sliding the tops off. Doing so, it can
be seen each one is stuffed full of fluffy carded
wool [wool, 2 cp per box]. These soft wads cushtable
VI: 5,000 gold pieces
ion more-valuable items. In the first box there is
a statue of a thrush carved from soapstone and
painted with blue and speckled green colors
[975 gp]. The next reveals a false hand made
from steel and silken thread, which a skilled surgeon
might perhaps be able to attach to an arm
stump [700 gp]. In the third box is a tiny bronze
orrery — a device used to model the movement
of planets around the sun, which moves by
clockwork [bronze orrery; 1,115 gp]. [The number
of suns and planets depends upon your particular
universe and may be something which characters will
not understand.] The fourth box contains four
thumb-high glass bottles with tight stoppers [1
gp each] which contain finely ground platinum
powder [100 gp per bottle]. The final container
holds two pairs of gloves which are exquisitely
embroidered with silver thread and dozens of
tiny carnelian chips [gloves; 900 gp per pair].
[One set is larger than the other, as if for a malefemale
couple.] [Total 5,000.3 gp]
99 There is a safe or strongbox built into the wall.
The safe is locked and the door is stout.
[Amazing lock. Magic, a suitable key or enormous
strength will be needed to open this door.] Once the
door is open, you look inside and notice first of
all a shelf divides the upper and lower parts. The
upper section contains a sheaf of papers written
in a variety of languages, none of which is familiar
[these relate to overseas business ventures which
have little value to outsiders]. The papers also
include a map which shows a small island
marked with sharks and dragons and the location
of a buried treasure of gems and cold, hard
cash. [The map appears genuine, it may be accurate
or not; 50 gp.] At the back of the top section is a
brown, leather bag [2 gp] which looks lumpy and
feels heavy. Looking inside, you find a portable
marble sundial — surely someone’s idea of a
joke, albeit nicely crafted [250 gp]. The lower
shelf of the safe is crammed with what appear to
be linen dolls [50 dolls; 46 dolls at 4 cp each] [If
the characters take time to seach through the dolls,
four unique dolls are found.] Three dolls are quite
heavy and are found to be stuffed with pure
ground platinum powder [3 dolls 1,200gp each].
Another doll wedged in the back has two emeralds
for eyes and a small carnelian stone used to
give the doll’s face the expression of a poet
[1,100 gp]. [Total 5,003.84 gp]
100 You see before you a stack of rolled pieces of
extremely heavyweight fabrics, beside which are
several bundles of fur. Further investigation of
the fur bundles reveal pelts cleaned, tanned and
ready for use. The softest of the pelts are small,
long and white, with black tipped tails [8 ermine
pelts, 100 gp each]. Next there are larger plush
specimens of fur with shades of silvery white,
grey and black. The supple pelts have nice contrast
and are of the highest grade [5 silver fox
pelts, 75 gp each]. There are a few pelts which
have reddish brown streaks fading to a light
golden tone along the edges [3 sable pelts, 75 gp
each], with a lone silky soft black pelt [1 mink
pelt, 50 gp]. Amongst the pelts is a pouch [2 sp]
with numerous coins [150 gp, 112 sp, 214 cp].
The stack of rolled fabrics is too unwieldy to
carry all together. [If characters examine the rolls:]
In the pile of rolled fabrics are three large intricately
woven woolen tapestries, each depicting a
comely maiden evidently of royal birth [350 gp
each]. With the tapestries are four heavier pieces
crafted into woolen rugs. Each has a different
woven pattern, with a fine, tight double weave
[500 gp each]. Inside one of the rugs is a large
square of supple leather marked with some sort
of drawing and rolled around a long carved
wooden totem [200 gp]. [The adventurers might
recognize the drawing on the leather as a fairly accurate
map of the realm; 50 gp.] [Total 4,913.54 gp]

Weapons and jewels and thrones;
oh, my!
All sets are valued at 10,000 gold pieces plus or minus
2%, or in other words 9,800 to 10,200 gp. The italicized
text contains values and information reserved for the game
master. In general, the GM will not immediately read this
text to the players; it is there for the GM to use as he or
she sees fit.
Roll d% and use the indicated set:
01-02 You see a throne-like oaken chair elaborately
carved with people and bears [500 gp], supplemented
with niches holding small gold statues
of horses [4 gold statues, 125 gp each]. In the chair
lie a string of green beads [jade beads; necklace,
825 gp], a gold ring with a large piece of amber
with an ant inside [ring, 250 gp] and a small
aquamarine on a silver chain [252 gp]. Lying partially
under the chair is a rapier with a gleaming
blue-green gem [aquamarine; rapier, 520 gp] on
the pommel. Its slender sheath is covered with
flowers made of gems [blue quartz, turquoise, pink
rhodochrosite and citrine; sheath 517 gp]. Next to
the chair you find a wooden rocking horse sized
for a human child [650 gp]. It is beautifully
carved of a single block of dark wood, and its
eyes are chunks of picture jasper with patterns
that actually look like eyes. The child-size saddle,
blanket, bit and bridle are fully functional
leather, wool and iron [bridle and bit, 2 gp; military-
style saddle, 25 gp; blanket, 1 gp]. A rough
wood box with a tight lid [1 gp] is packed with
straw and holds four handleless, sip-sized cups
and a matching pitcher closed by a cork, of very
fine green-glazed china with gold rims [sake set;
cups 25 gp each, pitcher 40 gp]. A similar but larger
box [2 gp] holds a wide fan made of peacock
feathers on an ivory frame, with a golden pearl
on each spoke [fan, 1,800 gp] and two white silk
pillows [450 gp each] embroidered with phoenixes
and other fantastic birds in gold and silver
thread using bright blue and green semiprecious
stones for bodies [lapis lazuli and malachite].
Below those are two gold brooches, each with a
deep blue spinel surrounded by six silver pearls
[jeweled brooches, 1,300 gp each], and a dagger
with a lavender jewel in the hilt [amethyst; dagger,
132 gp]. A small barrel [1 gp] is half-full of
coins [136 gp, 770 sp, 9,541 cp]. [Total 9,926.41
gp]
03-04 You see an unusual vessel, a trimaran [6,000
gp], sitting on the dark flagstones [dirt floor,
wooden planks, lichen-encrusted floor]. The sailing
boat’s three hulls are all intact and highly polished.
Made of dark wood, the hulls are decorated
with an intricate design of waves and stars.
The ship’s mast is broken off at the point where
it would reach a man’s chest, nor are there sails
to be found. The rest of the ship, however, is in
sound condition.
Small benches are set along the center of
each hull’s deck, and these are carved of a
vibrant, dark cherry wood. Each hull contains a
small cabin and living area, long enough for a
man to sleep comfortably and with enough
space and height for a small group of elves to
move about with little distress.
In one of the hulls you find garments [noble’s
outfit, 75 gp] befitting a nobleman, made of fine
silk and velvet. In addition to the garments you
discover a flask of alchemist’s fire [20 gp], four
gold pieces and nine silver pieces [4 gp, 9 sp].
Just behind the sailing vessel you discover a
large, ebony throne [3,750 gp]. The arms of the
throne are carved to resemble scowling,
chimerical faces, complete with forked tongues,
scowling eyes and curved fangs. At the head of
the throne is the cold, beautiful face of a trumpet
archon, its instrument held at its side. The
throne is bare of cushions or other adornments
save for the seven garnets set in a heraldic pattern
on the right arm.
Just beyond the throne is another unusual
item: a tall wooden fan [150 gp] on a heavy
wooden base, attached to a large mechanism of
gears and a hand-crank. The handle of the
hand-crank must have once been covered with
ivory but it seems thieves have pried chunks of
this off, leaving only a few slender splinters.
Each blade of the fan is carved to look like a
broad, jungle leaf, and the fan’s central spoke is
fashioned of black iron, and is free of rust. The
fan reaches higher than most men are tall by
about a foot’s length. [Total 9,999.9 gp]
05-06 You see a leather chest [15 gp] with brass
hinges and clasps, but no lock. A large rend on
the side of the chest indicates a previous attack,
possibly by someone wielding a small axe. Inside
the chest are a number of beautiful items, not
the least of which is an iron hammer [95 gp] with
a solid brass handle. The heavy tool is etched
Table VII:
10,000 Gold Pieces
115
with an intricate pattern of geometric chains
and flourishes. On one side of the handle, a fourpointed
star burns within the pattern’s center, its
own axis set with a single blue quartz cabochon.
Beside the hammer are two strings of beads,
each one threaded on coarse cotton fiber. One
string of beads [1,000 gp] contains ten large, hollow
gold beads, each shaped to depict an animal.
One of the beads resembles the fierce, noble face
of a bear, another recalls a snarling tiger. The
others portray hounds, birds, a serpent, a ram
and a hare. The other string [3,075 gp] contains
seven small beads of brass, each shaped in a perfectly
faceted octagonal tube, and twenty large
jade beads carved in a satisfyingly rounded helix
pattern. You also find a small, slender decanter
carved of solid rose quartz [5,230 gp]. A pattern
of birds in flight adorns the lower quadrants of
the decanter, while outstretched necks and
widespread wings of noble swans form the neck
of the object.
Last you discover a large intaglio [recessed
engraving; 185 gp], carved from chalcedony and
strung upon a finely made gold chain [400 gp].
The intaglio is executed on a piece of semitransparent
chalcedony, and portrays a dryad
among the boughs of her oak tree. Her hair
swirls like the currents of the wind itself and is
adorned with a chaotic posy of oak leaves. The
contour of the dryad’s simple gown and the patterned
lower border of the oak bough and leaves
correspond to the oval shape of the intaglio,
which is large enough to cover the larger area of
a woman’s palm. The stone seems stained with
dark, currant-colored ink, and it is probable it
was also used as a seal. [Total 10,000 gp]
07-08 In front of you is a rectangular chest with a
flat top [2 gp]. Sitting atop the chest is a golden
statuette of a weeping willow tree [2,250 gp].
You approach the chest and examine the tree.
The detail is quite impressive, with every part of
the tree fashioned from gold. The branches that
hang in an arc and the leaves of the tree are created
with exacting detail. You lift the statuette
[which stands two feet tall] so you can open the
chest to see what lies within.
On top of a pile of silver coins [43,550 sp] lies
a leather-bound book. There is no title on the
cover and as you lift the book you catch a whiff
of the smell of grass or something like it. You
open the book to the first page and see an oak leaf
clipped to the page with a small metal band. You
turn the page and find a leaf from a black locust
tree. Intrigued, you begin to flip through the
pages, and sure enough, every one has a single
leaf from a different tree on it. There are over one
hundred pages of tree leaves catalogued in the
book. You cannot imagine the time it must have
taken someone to collect all of the leaves here,
especially considering that not all of the trees are
indigenous to this area [rare book worth 340 gp to
a library or someone interested in the subject].
You set the book aside, realizing whoever
owned this chest was definitely a tree lover. You
sift through the silver coins and near the bottom
you feel something hard and rectangular. You
retrieve it to find an oaken box about a foot
wide by a hand span deep and tall [1 gp]. You
carefully remove the lid and your eyes fall upon
six brooches, each one made of platinum and
forged into the likeness of a leaf. The leaves represented
are dogwood, chestnut oak, sycamore,
witch hazel, honey locust, and mountain ash.
Each one is intricately designed and impressive
to behold [each brooch weighs a little over a pound;
520 gp each]. [Total 10,068 gp]
09-10 A battered old sea chest [15 sp] has a latch
but no lock. Inside you see two pairs of loose,
unbleached linen men’s pants [3 sp each], two
long tunics of the same material [2 sp each], a
pair of black leather half boots, highly polished
with big gold buckles and showing little sign of
wear [pair of boots, 50 gp] and a cloak made of
water-repellent oiled leather [3 gp]. A thin,
sharp throwing dagger with three red garnets in
the hilt [not masterwork; 305 gp] is wedged along
the side of the chest. A big metal fish on a strong
linen thread [a magnet used as a compass, 10 gp]
is stuck to the dagger’s blade. Below them is a
thick, warm dark gray wool cloak with a hood [6
gp]. A map on a rolled up piece of parchment
shows the position of some islands [a distant sea,
1 gp]. A cloth sack [1 sp] contains and protects
three metal boxes. The boxes are a finger length
on each side, and have tight-fitting tops painted
with pretty women in bright dresses [boxes, 6 sp
each]. The first is filled with a fine red powder
giving off a sharp smell [chili powder; 1 pound, 2
gp]. The second box is half full of an aromatic
yellow powder [curry; one-half pound, 6 gp]. In
the third box are small round black seeds [pepper;
one-half pound, 1 gp]. The chest also contains
a small oil painting of a seaside village [5
sp], three carefully carved wooden figures, just
over a handspan tall [two of old men, one of a boy
with a ball; 8 sp each] and a sack of coins [87 gp,
165 sp, 184 cp]. The bottom of the chest rattles
with pearls of all sorts [90 small silver pearls, 50
gp each; 11 pink and 10 gold pearls, 100 gp each; 6
black pearls, 500 gp each]. In a corner is a tiny
blue glass bottle stopped with a cork [8 sp]. It is
half filled with a thick, clear liquid [flowery perfume,
5 gp]. [Total 10,102.44 gp]
the mother of all treasure tables
116
11-12 A pile of objects sits in the gloom [near darkness;
torchlight; sunlight; light of the lamp]. The
largest of the group is a wooden case on small
bun feet, fashioned of silvery, smooth wood with
a mithral lock [Good lock] and hinges. Two glass
urns [100 gp each] are set upon the wooden case,
and these are of a ghostly, frosted white, with
etchings portraying large, elegant willow trees.
The silvery wooden case is unlocked and
when opened proves to be a very unusual gardener’s
box [3,250 gp]. There are seven compartments
making up the box’s interior, the
largest of which is on the left side and holds a
small mithral hand rake and shovel. Next largest
is the compartment closest to the box’s opening.
It has a simple wooden cover, opened by sliding
it backward, and reveals several pounds of fine
soil. The soil, like the box, is an unusual silvery
gray color, and emits an almost perfume-like,
earthy fragrance. The remaining rear compartments
have lids with small mithral knobs and
contain a variety of large, white, waxy seeds.
Some of these seeds have germinated—despite
the apparent lack of sunlight—and have sprouted
tiny wax-like plants or flowers.
Next to the wooden case is a suit of gnomish
half-plate [3,600 gp] wrought of adamantine and
sized for a male gnome of average stature. A
filthy hempen sack [3 cp] sits slumped on the
floor beside the half-plate, and when the contents
of this are spilled onto the floor, you see a
jumbled confusion of brass, onyx, bamboo and
glass hollow tubes; each are connected by thick
silken cord. Upon closer inspection you discover
this tangled collection to be a rather large set
of wind chimes [900 gp]. There are, in total, 10
tubes of brass, 10 tubes of carved, light brown
onyx, 20 tubes of bamboo and 5 tubes of green
glass. Along with the snarled wind chime is a
pair of leather sandals [50 gp] with silver buckles,
and a pair of gold hairpins [2,100 gp], each set
with a black opal. [Total 10,100.03 gp]
13-14 You find a long, low wooden box, elaborately
carved with patterns of small branches and
slender pointed leaves [45 gp]. The box is about
two thirds as wide as a man’s armspan, with silver
hinges and latch. Inside, a wide white linen
cloth covers the contents [16 gp]. Folding it
aside reveals a shimmering suit of scale mail, its
silvery scales the shape of pointed leaves [mithral
armor; 4,050 gp]. It is of a size suitable for a slender
human woman or an elf.
Below the armor lies a sword belt of pale
leather the color of birch bark [2 gp], and two
blades in matching scabbards. One is a
longsword with a leaf-shaped pommel, slightly
longer and more slender than the average blade.
Its keen edge and elegant lines show it was obviously
made by a master’s hand [masterwork; 315
gp]. In the other sheath is a matching dagger, also
slender and slightly longer than normal, but with
a blade of darker gray [adamantine; 3,002 gp].
Tucked into a corner of the box is a small bag
of ivory silk [2 gp]. It holds a man’s silver ring
with a gleaming, round opal at least as large as a
man’s thumbnail [2,395 gp]. [Total 9,827 gp]
15-16 This place looks like it is used for storage,
and it appears the owner has an intense interest
in furs. Several different animal furs are hung
from pegs on the walls. All of the furs have been
altered so they can be worn. The first you
approach is the fur of a winter wolf fashioned to
be worn over the body like a poncho [235 gp].
Next you come to the fur of a small black bear
fashioned so it can be worn as a cloak [95 gp].
Another fur hanging on the wall is red fox, and
it has been altered so that it can be worn as a
cape, where the fox’s head sits atop yours and its
body flows down the back of your neck [75 gp].
On the ground below the fox fur you notice
something laughable. Two small, white rabbit
furs have been sewn so into fuzzy, ridiculous
looking slippers [25 gp].
You turn your gaze away from the rabbit slippers
and notice a small peg at about [human] eye
level. It does not look like the other pegs on the
walls. [If the players look more closely, read:] You
discover there is a small crack on the wall forming
a square around the peg [crack is about two
and half feet square with the peg being in the center].
[If the adventurers pull on the peg:] You pull on
the peg and a hidden compartment opens up to
your view. Inside, the first thing you see is a canvas
bag [2 sp]. Retrieving it, you open the bag to
discover it holds a tidy sum of gold coins [3,390
gp]. Behind where the bag was resting you find
an intricate diorama made of pure gold. The diorama
portrays a pack of wolves in a forest. When
you lift it from its dark resting place you can see
the scene better. You marvel at the artwork and
notice the pack has a human female trapped up
in a tree, and she seems to have no way of
escape. The piece is so detailed you can see the
fear on her face, and the snarling lips of the
wolves. Every piece of the diorama is carved
from pure gold and it is truly beautiful [the diorama
is almost two feet square; 3,870 gp].
You look again into the hole and discover it is
not yet empty. In the very back of the opening
you find two silver daggers with very special
hilts. The hilt of each dagger is carved into the
likeness of a fierce, raging bear. The daggers are
crafted so when you place them side by side [in
the correct manner] they are facing each other.
table VII: 10,000 gold pieces
117
Like the detail of the diorama, these daggers are
truly a rare prize indeed [1,150 gp each]. [Total
9,990.2 gp]
17-18 The treasure is piled chaotically: cloaks piled
on tunics, swords protruding, and below everything—
jewelry. After sorting, you find four wool
cloaks: two large blue ones [2 gp each], one smaller,
green one [2 gp] and one large, yellow cloak
trimmed in rabbit fur [4 gp]. There are five linen
robes: two large (a brown and a green), two
medium-sized blue ones, and one small and reddish
[5 sp each], along with two white wool
tunics for a medium-sized female human [2 sp
each].
The weapons include six short swords: four
plain [10 gp each], one with a perfect sardonyx in
the pommel [masterwork sword, 420 gp], and the
last with four rose quartz and a red spinel [masterwork
sword, 625 gp]. Three longswords are
decorated with gems: one with a peridot [masterwork
sword, 370 gp], one with three moonstones
[masterwork sword, 480 gp] and the third with
two tourmalines [masterwork sword, 525 gp].
There are also 12 daggers: one almost the size of
a shortsword [3 gp], six unadorned [2 gp each] and
two sleek ivory throwing daggers [20 gp each].
Three daggers are jeweled: one with a fine zircon
[masterwork, 144 gp], another with a pink pearl
surrounded by four pieces of onyx [325 gp] and
the last has an aquamarine set in gold [600 gp].
You also find a scimitar [525 gp] with a blue
blade and a blue spinel in the hilt lying beside a
composite longbow [100 gp].
The jewelry includes a dramatic holy symbol
[750 gp] of a sea god, golden with six golden
pearls [750 gp] on a chain of green beads [jade,
25 pieces; 1250 gp], a gold ring with a greenish
garnet [125 gp], a thin gold chain [15 gp], a silver
brooch [410 gp] with four pale amethysts, a pair
of delicate silver earrings [10 gp], a pair of gold
earrings with a rose quartz [150 gp] and a large
bright orange coral pendant [600 gp].
Also in the pile are two paintings, a silver
tray, and a large chest [3 gp] of coins [50 pp, 90
gp, 1621 sp, 12,622 cp]. One painting is in a
frame of gilded wood and is a portrait of a beautiful
black-skinned, black-haired woman in a
rich aqua dress, painted by a master [frame, 5 gp,
dimensions 2’ x 1’; picture, 300 gp]. The other
picture shows some mountains in spring. You
can recognize the peaks and the workmanship is
extraordinary [500 gp]. The tray, about a forearm
long and half that wide, has elaborate raised silverwork
[40 gp]. [Total 10,003.22 gp]
19-20 The first thing you see is a military saddle [20
gp] sitting on top of a metal and leather bundle.
When you get closer you see the saddle has stirrups
with leather pockets attached to the outsides.
[The right side is a couch for a lance or standard
while riding and the left is a holder for the tip of
a bow; it enables a bow to be strung quickly while at
full speed.] Leaning against the saddle is a large
round shield, covered in leather and generously
studded with steel [12 gp].
The saddle is resting on top of a set of breastplate
armor [masterwork, 350 gp]. The steel
cuirass is lined in a brown fur. The leather ties
securing the halves together are a bit frayed
[though they could easily be replaced], but the fur
lining is in good repair. The other pieces of the
armor are packed inside the cuirass. The helmet
is a steel conical helm well rounded on the top
and lined with a gray fur [monkey fur]. The fur
actually covers the bottom two inches of the
outside of the helm as well as having two cheek
pieces [which would cover the wearer’s cheeks and
ears, for comfort on cold rides] tied up over the
crown of the helm with leather thongs. The
greaves and thigh plates are also fur lined. With
the armor are two folded shirts of raw white silk
[15 gp each]. [The silk shirts are of a special tight
weave that is very difficult to puncture, even for
edged or pointed weapons. Often the skin is parted
by the opponent’s weapon but the silk is merely
pushed into the wound, keeping the wound clean
and easy to treat. Even arrow wounds are easier to
treat because the silk allows the arrows to be gently
tugged out of the wound along their twisting entry
path, keeping the wound small and clean.]
Under the armor you find several weapons.
First is a long gracefully curved scimitar [masterwork,
315 gp], well oiled in its scabbard. Next is
a composite short bow [masterwork, 375 gp] and a
leather quiver with forty arrows [2 gp], as well as
a second quiver with twenty more arrows. [When
the latter arrows are examined it can be seen they
each have three small holes drilled at different angles
through the shaft. These are signal arrows; when
fired they emit a high-pitched scream all the way to
their target which is very effective for highlighting special
targets on the battlefield, and for psychological
effect; 20 masterwork arrows, 121 gp set.]
Inside the helmet in a small leather pouch [1
gp] are three cut, but unmounted gems, a handful
of coins [16 gp, 24 sp, 8 cp], and an ivory silk
bag [2 gp]. Inside the silk bag is silver chain. A
slender oval pendant, nearly a thumb’s length
long, hangs from the chain. In its center is a gorgeous,
deep purple stone [alexandrite], framed in
shining silver [3,200 gp]. Two of the stones loose
in the pouch are ovals, one red and one blue,
each with a white star glowing in its center [star
the mother of all treasure tables
118
ruby and star sapphire; 2,000 gp each]. Also loose
is a gleaming purple gem the size of a coin [violet
garnet; 2,000 gp]. [Total 10,446.48 gp]
21-22 Myriad objects lie in a jumbled heap, but
your eyes first catch the tarnished glow of a
large, heavily gilded screen [4,535 gp]. The
screen is made of two panels, each as high as an
elf is tall, connected by three large, ornate brass
hinges and covered with a resplendent pattern
of gilt, enamel, tiny gems and silk. The top-most
portion of the screen features a sky busy with
birds of prey: hawks, eagles, ospreys and falcons,
each hunting flocks of smaller doves and
pigeons. Further down the panels a setting sun is
sinking behind the tree line of a forest, and
etched against the horizon are the deep blue turrets,
rooftops and spires of a castle. At the bottommost
portion of the screen noble men and
women meander along the banks of a river.
Amid the collection of items on the floor in
front of the screen are two remarkable weapons:
a greatsword [masterwork greatsword; 1,090 gp]
with a unique mithral handle and a repeating
crossbow [masterwork crossbow; 850 gp] with a
case of bolts [cold iron bolts; set of 5, 11 gp]. The
sword’s handle shows a tableau of ferocious lions
climbing upon one another in fury. Beneath the
beasts are two wild boars locked in a similar
struggle to the death. In contrast to the brutal
scene above it, the sword’s blade is inscribed
with a delicate, flowing pattern of vines framing
a glowing sun. The blade shines coldly, and is
plated with alchemical silver. The crossbow’s
heavy stock is crafted of fine wood and decorated
with engraved ivory inlay depicting a cockatrice.
The steel bow is black and still in excellent
condition, but the heavy gut string shows signs
of decay. The bolt case holds five bolts, each
tipped with cold iron and in good condition.
Beside the weapons is a more benevolent set
of objects, which appears to be a menagerie of
glazed, clay animals possibly used to amuse a
child. A fox, cat, hound, peacock, dove and
horse, all brightly painted with large soulful
eyes, are set on a clay tray seven by eight hand
widths in size. The surface of the tray is painted
and shaped to resemble a garden with a tiny
river flowing through it [tray, 240 gp]. Each of
the animals is less than a handwidth in height.
[Close inspection will show the eyes are all pieces of
jet; 6 animals, 210 gp each.] Next to the clay toys
is a beautiful jeweled glass candleholder [2,000
gp] on the end of a brass-plated wooden staff.
The candleholder is capped by two brass end
pieces and set with chrysoberyls and citrines. A
rather plain but well-shaped glass teapot [10 gp]
sits humbly beside the other treasures. [Total
9,996 gp]
23-24 You see two bundles of long staves, bound
together with rope and with their ends tied in
canvas sacks, and four chests of various sizes. If
the sacks are removed, the staves are revealed to
be polearms, their broad blades and spiked
guards having been hidden by the canvas [12
glaives; 8 gp each]. Two of the chests are rather
plain [2 gp each]. One holds dark blue wool fabric.
If unfolded, the cloth proves to be heavy
hooded cloaks [with insignia sewn on the left breast
in white thread of a four-armed cross inside a shield
outline], a dozen of them in all [2 gp each]. Below
the cloaks lie four plain leather backpacks, all
empty [2 gp each]. The other chest holds gray
wool – a dozen winter blankets [5 sp each]. In the
bottom of the chest are two sets of horse tack [2
gp each] and four clean horse blankets [3 sp each].
Another, smaller chest with a sturdy lock [Good
lock; chest 83 gp] holds eleven bags of coins [bags,
1 sp each]. Six bags, practically the same size,
contain gold pieces [300 gp each], one has platinum
[47 pp], two hold silver [282 sp each] and
two copper [347 cp each].
The final chest, also locked [Good lock; chest,
83 gp], has more fabric at one end. A short stool
whose carved legs are made of a highly polished
black walnut takes up the other end. The square
cushioned top is covered with a deep golden velvet,
and golden thread tassels dangle from each
corner [36 gp]. Here the cloth is two soft, thick
wool blankets in dark blue [2 gp each], and below
them a set of winter clothing for a well-off man
[courtier’s outfit, 38 gp]. In the bottom sits a box
of polished cedar [4 gp]. Inside the cedar box is a
lady’s silk scarf, pale pink embroidered with tiny
flowers in gold and spring green [60 gp]. The
scarf wraps around something flat and oval – a
hand-size portrait painted on a piece of ivory
[160 gp]. It shows a woman with golden brown
hair and green eyes, no longer in her youth but
lovely nonetheless, wearing jewelry with green
stones matching her eyes. A small ivory rod,
which fits into an indentation in the back, acts
as a stand.
Below the scarf lie two bags of ivory silk [3 gp
each]. The first holds a necklace made of fine
gold chain, braided in short lengths. Between
each section are two amethyst beads: one lavender
and one a darker purple. There are six sets of
stones, and seven sections of chain. A pendant
hangs at the center front, a beautiful sea-green
aquamarine, shaped as an inch-long teardrop
and perfectly faceted to catch the light [necklace
with pendant, 4,493 gp]. The other soft bag holds
a tiara of gold, its slender frame supporting a
matching aquamarine shaped as a faceted oval
[2,587 gp]. You recognize these as the jewels
from the portrait. [Total 10,031.64 gp]
table VII: 10,000 gold pieces
119
25-26 You find a bronze plate as wide as a child is
tall [4,700 gp], lying on a pristine white rug
made from the hide of a snow leopard [450 gp].
A small strongbox with ivory inlays on its lid
[155 gp] sits atop the plate, alongside a hexagonal
game board made of cherry and white-pine
woods [180 gp]. Pieces of horn line the edges of
the board. Marble game pieces for this board [42
altogether, 15 gp each] are scattered all over the
plate, as are several dozen coins from different
countries [90 gp, 15 sp]. Half of the game pieces
are in the shape of hatching dragons, while the
other half look like coiled snakes; each piece is
the size of a grape, and their likenesses are
exquisite.
The massive plate itself weighs as much as a
suit of chainmail, and a procession of fantastical
creatures is carved on its surface in a wide spiral.
Four pearlescent fire opals are set in the center
of the plate in a partial star pattern; the fifth
gem, which would complete the star, is missing.
The strongbox is locked [Good lock], but the
key – a heavy bit of brass with a wooden handle
– sits in the lock. It turns smoothly, and the lid
opens to reveal two leather cylinders nestled in
black velvet. Inside each cylindrical case is a
spyglass made of brass, with silver scrollwork at
each end [1,210 gp each]. Strapped to the inside
of the box’s lid are a matching pair of magnifying
glasses [680 gp each], each of which has a
brass handle chased with silver. Where the circle
of glass joins the handle, one magnifying
glass is set with a brilliant aquamarine, while the
other boasts a many faceted yellow topaz. [Total
9,986.5 gp]
27-28 Here is gleaming breastplate armor bearing a
stylized oak tree in a raised design with its
branches reaching out toward the shoulders and
the trunk extending down to the navel [mithral
armor; 4,200 gp]. Near the armor is a matching
shield [mithral; 1,009 gp] and a black leather
scabbard holding an elegant longsword with
beautiful and lethal lines. The sword has a black
hilt, an acorn-shaped pommel set with a glowing
green emerald and a leaf-patterned cross guard
[masterwork longsword, 1,915 gp].
A red linen cloth [2 gp] lies between the front
and rear pieces of the armor, wrapped around a
small leather pouch and a golden scepter. The
scepter’s design forms into an orb at the top
which looks like the crown of an oak tree. The
handle of the scepter is the trunk, and its
branches are set with a subtle sprinkling of tiny
glistening emerald chips [scepter, 1,200 gp]. In
the pouch [2 gp] you find platinum pieces and a
few gold pieces [27 pp, 6 gp], and a gold signet
ring bearing the same tree design as the armor
with a dozen tiny emeralds set around the outside
of the seal [1,400 gp]. [Total 10,004 gp]
29-30 You find two longswords, one plain [15 gp]
and one with a large rock crystal in the pommel
[70 gp], a handaxe [6 gp] and a light repeating
crossbow [250 gp]. A bullseye lantern [12 gp], six
plain brass eating plates [2 sp each] and six silver
goblets with vine decorations [10 gp each] sit
beside a bag [2 sp]. The loosely woven sack holds
a change of clothes for a small man: a blue silk
robe [10 gp] with white hose [2 gp].
Beside the bag is a highly polished wooden
box [15 gp], locked with a tiny, intricate lock
[good lock, DC 30 to open without breaking]. The
box is maple with walnut inserts and is lined
with green silk. It holds four rings, a bracelet and
a brooch. Two of the rings are plain gold [15 gp
each], one is silver with a large silvery black
stone [malachite, 110 gp], and the last has three
sards and three moonstones across it [310 gp].
The bracelet [10 gp] is made of complex silver
links. The brooch [3,000 gp] is gold with four
alexandrites set around a black pearl. A false
bottom in the box, under the lining, slides back
to reveal six fine green stones [emeralds, 1000 gp
each].
There are three small leather bags [1 sp each]
under the sack and beside the box. The first
holds pewter buttons [85 buttons in 33 designs, 1
sp each]. The second contains colored pieces of
opaque crystal [of sugar: hard candies, fruit flavored;
60 pieces, 5 cp each]. The third bulges with
coins and a few irregular pearls [72 gp, 57 sp, 39
cp and 9 freshwater pearls, 10 gp each]. [Total
10,081.29 gp]
31-32 A large piece of canvas [8 gp] covers something
an arm span wide and knee high. Under it
is a statue of a mermaid, as long as a man’s outstretched
arms, made of pale green marble shot
through with veins of ivory and deep green
[2,000 gp]. The carving makes a series of dark
green veins appear as the mermaid’s hair, while
more green and ivory accent her tail. She is
basking on her back, hands at her sides and face
lifted to the sky. The statue rests on a short, rectangular
pedestal. The mermaid’s abdomen is
completely straight and flat, and a sundial is set
onto it. Lying on the floor along the side of the
mermaid is a fat, red roll about two third the
statue’s length. Rough twine [1 cp] binds it into
a bundle. In the shadow of the creature’s tail are
a square wooden box and two bags.
The rolled bundle is a long, narrow rug [15
feet long by 4 feet wide; 65 gp] woven of heavy
wool dyed a deep, even crimson. The rug is good
quality, smooth and tightly woven, with matching
thread tassels on each end. The lid of the
wooden box [2 gp] simply lifts up, and inside are
nine divisions. Two of them are empty, but the
the mother of all treasure tables
120
other seven hold small silver bottles, with silverand-
cork stoppers. Each is slightly different in
shape, but all are the height of a woman’s hand,
with stoppers shaped like small fir cones. [If lifted:]
The bottles feel as if they contain liquid.
[They did at one time contain strong perfume, but
the scent has soured. If opened, the smell is terrible;
bottles, 18 gp each.]
One sack is made of common canvas [1 sp].
Inside you find seven oyster shells, already
cracked open. Oddly, their meat remains inside
them, though it is dry and withered. Embedded
still inside each shell is a pale golden pearl [100
gp each]. There is also a small black velvet bag [3
gp] holding two round red stones, the size and
color of ripe, sweet cherries [garnets; 900 gp
each]. Lying under the oysters is a twist of paper,
waxed on the inside, holding a slightly sticky
mess of sweets. Seven pale yellow, round candies
have melted together into one blobby form. [If
tested, they are slightly tart; 1 cp total]. A tiny bag
of white silk [2 gp] has fallen to the bottom of
the sack; it protects a gleaming diamond, held
with slender fingers of platinum to a smooth
platinum band [5,250 gp].
The other sack, made of smooth gray wool [2
gp], holds a crown of silvery metal, slightly dented
in several places. A diamond-shaped red
stone highlights each of the crown’s seven
points. [The crown is made of tin set with shaped
pieces of red glass; 7 gp.] [Total 9,965.12 gp]
33-34 A blackened and charred barrel sits in a corner
of the room, a tall staff [27 gp] protruding
from its open top. The staff is made of
mahogany, with a central grip of cold iron, and
topped with the antlers of a young stag. As you
investigate the barrel more closely, you also see
something long and slender wrapped in smudged
grey wool [1 gp]. Unwrapping it, you find a beautiful
silk parasol [230 gp] with handle and ribs of
ebony. Tiny tassels wrought of fine golden
thread dangle from every other tip of the parasol,
alternating with tassels of white silk. Each
panel of the parasol portrays a different scene of
courtly life: one panel shows ladies being entertained
by a handsome bard, another panel shows
a grand winter feast, and another bears a manat-
arms courting a maiden.
Next to the barrel lies a dagger with a carved
handle [22 gp] in a gold scabbard [8,178 gp]
adorned with eight emeralds. The raised decoration
of the sheath shows various hunting motifs,
complex strapwork and the former owner’s elaborate
monogram, now rubbed nearly illegible by
the touch of many hands. All one can make out
is the letter “S” in common script. The tip of the
dagger’s handle is fashioned as the portrait of a
dutiful hunting dog, and upon the handle is a
name in common script: “Agnon”; possibly that
of the depicted hound.
Although the sooty, charred barrel is rather
tall [it reaches to the middle of a man’s chest], it is
easily tipped to spill the remaining contents
gently to the floor. These are a well maintained
steel falchion [75 gp], a sturdy canvas sack [2 sp]
and nearly two hundred loose coins [85 pp, 48
gp, 50 sp]. The falchion looks as if it has seen little
battle and bears nary a scratch upon blade or
hilt. The sack holds a silver music box [400 gp]
and a decorative magnifying glass [150 gp]. The
music box is crescent shaped, and when opened
plays a lilting, melancholy song reminiscent of
eventide and twilight. The magnifying glass has
a pewter frame and a thick handle carved to
resemble a tree trunk. [Total 9,986.2 gp]
35-36 You have entered a room used to hastily
store many kinds of items. There are weapons,
armor and other various items lying all about.
Most of the weapons and armor are in a ruined
condition, but you do find several pieces that are
serviceable. You gather a longsword [15 gp], a
throwing axe [8 gp], a warhammer [12 gp], a
greataxe [20 gp], a set of leather armor [10 gp], a
suit of splint mail armor [200 gp], and a suit of
half-plate armor [600 gp]. There is a large clutter
of items all stacked beside and on top of each
other in the far corner of the room, and you
move to investigate. There are torn pieces of
clothing, more ruined weapons and armor, and
all types of utterly useless debris, but you take
the time to go through it all just to make sure
you do not miss something worthwhile.
Underneath all of the rubbish you find an old
canvas covering nine paintings. Each one is
framed in a silver frame and they all are quite
stunning to behold. Every painting portrays a
different battle scene, and in each one the forces
of evil seem to be defeating the forces of good.
There is no marking to tell you who the artist is,
but you can tell these paintings are rare pieces of
art [worth 1,025 each]. [Total 10,090 gp]
37-38 You find what looks like the contents of a
small trading ship or merchant’s wagon: a stack
of bolts of brightly colored silk, three small
crates, a rack of weapons partially covered by a
sheet of sailcloth, and a large upright box of dark
wood. Throwing back the sailcloth [36 gp], you
see the rack of weapons holds a mix of four short
swords with leather-wrapped handles [masterwork,
310 gp each], three battle axes with
knurled wooden grips [masterwork, 310 gp each],
three warhammers with spiked iron heads [masterwork,
312 gp each], and a single massive
table VII: 10,000 gold pieces
121
greatsword [masterwork, 350 gp] supported across
the top of the rack [10 gp]. All of the weapons
appear to be of exceptional quality, and they
glisten with a thin sheen of oil. They are
strapped onto the rack with black leather cords,
and the pommel of each weapon is stamped with
the symbol of a falcon in flight.
Each of the six bolts of silk [50 yards per bolt,
500 gp each] is wrapped in a sheepskin [1 gp each]
and tied up with twine, leaving only the rolled
ends visible; two of the bolts are a brilliant blue,
one is bright red and the remaining three are the
color of an overcast sky, with a slight shimmer to
them.
Prying up the corners of the three crates [5 sp
each], you see they are full of tiny cloth pouches
[15 in each crate, 5 sp each]. Inside each pouch is
a ball of fleece, and nestled in the fleece are a
handful of freshwater pearls [4 per pouch, 180
altogether, 10 gp each]. The pearls are all slightly
irregular, each one different from the others.
This leaves the upright box [2 gp], which has
a long series of fresh scratches across its front, as
if it was raked by the claws of a large animal.
Inside is a full set of half-plate armor broken
down into its component parts [masterwork;
1,666 gp], with all the pieces wrapped in oiled
cloth [3 square yards, 3 sp per square yard].
Unwrapping a few pieces at random, you see
they are decorated with a pattern of interlocking
diamonds. The diamonds are all a deep green in
color, save for one on each piece of armor that is
sea blue. The edges of the sea blue diamonds are
traced in gold. [Total 10,000.9 gp]
39-40 You find five trunks, in good condition, all of
the same style [2 gp each] and six leather cases of
various odd sizes and shapes. Inside each trunk is
a dress of burgundy velvet, trimmed with silver
lace. The dresses are nearly identical, having full
sleeves with long, tight cuffs and slightly low-cut
bodices. Also packed with each dress is a full
lacy petticoat and two pairs of matching velvet
slippers [five courtiers’ outfits, 30 gp each].
Each trunk also has a few personal items. The
first trunk holds a green linen sack [5 sp] with a
carved ivory comb [32 sp] and an elegant silver
and pink necklace. The necklace has lengths of
delicate silver chain connecting clusters of pink
gems – pink pearls set between pairs of rose
quartz beads. There are nine such groups of gems
on this necklace [1,335 gp].
The second trunk includes a fine leather
shoulder bag [4 gp] which holds a polished oak
box [8 sp]. Inside the box lie two pieces of jewelry.
A shimmering necklace with a triple strand
of silver holds a sparkling rose quartz oval set in
a silver frame. From this hangs a lustrous gray
pearl [necklace, 189 gp]. Beside this a faceted
stone of deep burgundy [garnet] is held in a plain
silvery frame [platinum]. The stone, an oval the
size of a lady’s thumbnail, hangs on a double
chain of platinum [necklace, 1,530 gp].
The third trunk has a small black wooden box
[8 sp]. Inside, on linen padding, rests a silver
pendant strung on a set of five thin silk cords.
The pendant is roughly diamond shaped but its
frame is made of swooping lines rather than
straight. In the center of the frame dangles
another diamond-shaped piece of silver, in
which is set a gleaming black opal the size of a
man’s thumbnail [necklace, 1,790 gp]. In the
next trunk, under the clothing, lies a polished
flat box with a reddish hue [2 gp]. Inside the box,
a small piece of pink silk [1 gp] is wrapped
around a multistrand necklace of hundreds of
tiny freshwater pearls with accents of color provided
by small, faceted garnets and rose quartz
[necklace, 2,522 gp].
The final trunk, in addition to the elaborate
clothing, holds a blue silk pouch [2 gp] with a
double-strand necklace made of small matching
garnet beads [necklace, 2,246 gp]. Instead of a
pendant, the necklace is accented with a cylindrical
silver filigree slide.
Of the leather cases, two are cylindrical [4 gp
each], one rectangular and fairly small [4 gp], two
are different sizes of oblong cases [6 gp, 10 gp]
and one is an odd, almost triangular shape [10
gp]. In the cases are musical instruments: two
drums of different pitches [5 gp each], a slender
silver flute [masterwork, 100 gp], a lute [5 gp], a
larger lute with a pleasant tenor pitch [masterwork,
100 gp] and an elegant carved harp [masterwork,
100 gp]. [Total 10,168.1 gp]
41-42 Three chests sit against the back wall. You
approach them and notice each is identical in
size and construction. The chests are unusual in
that the bands, which wrap around and hold the
wood together, are forged from gold [75 gp each].
You open the chest to the far left and discover a
stack of scroll tubes. There are a total of twenty
empty tubes suitable for holding scrolls or maps.
Each tube is carved out of ivory, and they all
seem to be in good condition [35 gp each].
You open the chest in the middle and learn it
is filled with gold [6,399 gp]. You try to determine
if there is anything else of worth in the
chest, but you find nothing other than the coins.
You move on to the chest on the right and open
it, eager to see what lies within. Inside you find
an alchemist’s lab, complete with everything
you would need to perform alchemical experiments
[500 gp]. Also in the chest you find rare
ingredients, which could be used with the lab. A
the mother of all treasure tables
122
vial marked ‘dragon’s blood’ [155 gp], a small
container marked ‘beholder brain sample’ [135
gp], a glass bottle that looks empty with a label
reading ‘essence of ghost’ [250 gp], a tiny box
marked ‘sprite’s wings’ [35 gp], and a bottle
marked ‘fire giant heart sample’ [120 gp]. Finally
in the corner of the last chest you find a small,
heavy flask seemingly forged from pure platinum
that has a label on it reading ‘Super Healing
Potion.’ Unfortunately the flask is empty; whoever
owned it must have imbibed its contents at
an earlier date [platinum flask, weight 3 pounds;
1,510 gp]. [Total 10,029 gp]
43-44 You find a suit of ornamental full plate armor
of exceptional manufacture, complete with a
crested helm, gauntlets and a sword belt [masterwork,
7,650 gp]. There is a sheath on the sword
belt made for a longsword, but it hangs empty.
The suit of armor itself is sized for a tall human,
and the breastplate and helm are covered in
elaborate black enamel designs chased with
gold. The helm features an ancient oak tree on
either side, scattering leaves as if it were
autumn. Between the trees is the helm’s crest,
which is as high as a man’s hand and made of
red-dyed horsehair. The motif of fallen leaves is
continued on the breastplate, with the oak
leaves gradually becoming life-sized as they
reach the waist edge of the armor. In the center
of the breastplate is the armor’s most striking
feature: a rosette formed of twenty pink pearls,
with a trio of emeralds inside it surrounding a
single large star sapphire at its center.
Next to the suit of armor is a pair of crossed
battle axes [masterwork; 330 gp each] mounted
on the inside of a round steel shield [22 gp].
There are hooks on the front of the shield,
which is unadorned, to allow it to be hung on a
wall. The blade of one axe is decorated with an
oak branch, thick with leaves, while the blade of
the other is etched with a pattern of stars.
Underneath the shield is a worn canvas sack
[1 sp] that jingles when you pick it up. Inside is a
pair of enameled spurs matching the suit of plate
[10 gp], a small pouch containing two uncut purple
gems [violet garnets, 400 gp each], several
handfuls of coins [55 pp, 144 gp, 339 sp] and the
hilt of a sword, broken just above the crossguard
[130 gp]. The rest of the blade is missing, and
only about an inch of it protrudes from the hilt.
The handle is carved to look like a unicorn’s
horn, and inlaid with silver and jet. The pommel
is a single steel oak leaf, the ends of which wrap
around and up the base of the hilt, while the
crosspiece is plain steel. [Total 10,000 gp]
45—46 You are surprised by what you see here. The
floor is practically covered with coins of all
kinds. Copper, silver, gold and platinum litter
the entire surface of the floor. You also notice a
circular hole in the ceiling that is about two feet
in diameter. It looks as if someone or something
has been depositing treasure into this room as if
it were a waste receptacle [210 pp; 2,980 gp;
36,490 sp; 123,567 cp]. When you approach the
area under the hole your nose is overwhelmed
with a foul, rotting smell, which seems to come
from above. You again turn your attention to the
coins clinking and clanking under your feet.
There are thousands of them, most of them
being copper pieces, and it will take hours and
probably more than one trip to retrieve them all
and get them out of this room to a safe place.
[This is enough coins for a random pile to cover a 16
by 16 foot floor to a depth of approximately one
inch]. [Total 9,964.67 gp]
47-48 Gathered together in the gloom [day light,
torch light, flickering lamp light, moon light], you
see myriad objects of medium size. Whatever
light is available suddenly triples in intensity as
it is refracted and returned by a large, bowlshaped
parabolic mirror [1,700 gp] leaning
against the nearest wall. The smooth, polished
surface of this instrument is shaped like an
inverted drum, and has large copper handles to
assist its transport. It sits on a heavy wooden
base.
In addition to the mirror you see a glazed, clay
stove [297 gp], with a pleasing, round shape and
vibrant, colorful pattern worked into its glaze.
The pattern shows several stylized peasants and
chickens gathered in the grass outside a country
cottage. A few nuggets of wood remain in the
stove’s interior, which is easily accessible
through a door-less, semicircular opening in the
front of the stove. A tall, round, pipe-like chimney
sits atop the stove to let smoke rise out. The
stove is all shaped from one piece of clay, and
weighs about as much as a barrel of sand. As you
look closer at the remains of the last fire lit in
the belly of the stove, you catch a glint of dull
yellow and silver. Further investigation reveals
eight yellow topaz stones [500 gp each] and 20
silver pieces, all coated in a prodigious layer of
soot.
Just beyond the stove sits an unusually fashioned
harp [4,000 gp], wrought of electrum. The
harp has a curved neck, and no forepillars to
strengthen and support the neck. Topping the
arched frame of the harp is a carved likeness of a
human face, its expression gentle and lost in
thought. When plucked, the strings produce a
soft, pleasant tone. Next to the harp is a small
table VII: 10,000 gold pieces
123
wooden chest [1 gp] in good condition. When
you open the chest you discover a few small
sheets of paper, but these crumble to pieces at
your touch. [Total 10,000 gp]
49-50 You find a huge brass bathtub with clawed
feet [400 gp], large enough for two human adults.
It is full to the point of overflowing with a wide
range of treasures. The tub itself has been turned
into a portable container: two stout wooden
poles are lashed along the sides to serve as handles,
allowing it to be carried on the shoulders of
four or more people.
Inside the tub, you find several layers of
items. The top layer is mostly clothes, jumbled
together untidily as if thrown into the tub in
haste. All mixed together, you find three royal
outfits [200 gp each] and two noble outfits [75 gp
each], sized for human women; seven sets of
dwarven clerics’ vestments [5 gp each]; and two
human-sized scholars’ outfits, both of which are
stained with blood [2 gp each].
Underneath the clothes are a number of
other objects: two paintings of ships at sea, both
about two hand spans wide and set in elaborate
gilded frames [200 gp each], twelve heavy silver
place settings, each including a plate, bowl, goblet
and three utensils [240 gp per setting], and a
cane holder made from a hollowed-out ogre’s
foot [75 gp].
Below these items, the tub is filled a
handspan deep with a huge pile of mixed coins
[1,238 gp, 3,548 sp, 65,320 cp]; a slightly dented
portable ram [10 gp] protrudes from the pile of
coinage. At the very bottom of the tub, completely
buried under the coins, are three objects
carefully wrapped in tablecloths of ivory linen
[28 gp each]. Two are matching scimitars, each
with a piece of amber the size of a grape set into
its pommel [masterwork, 1,015 gp each]. Their
blades are etched on both sides with scenes of
sea battles between pirates and merchant ships.
The third cloth-wrapped object is an ornate
rapier, its hilt made of ridged horn wrapped with
silver wire [masterwork, 1,250 gp]. This sword’s
blade is plain, though clearly made of the finest
steel, but the crosspiece more than makes up for
this: it is set on each side with a large amethyst,
and both ends are tipped with circles of jet.
[Total 10,164 gp]
51-52 Here you find a wooden trunk, rubbed with
a dark green stain and bound in brass. It has a
good quality brass lock [Good lock; trunk, 84 gp].
Inside the trunk a green cloak [1 gp] is tucked in
around the other contents. Under the cloak is a
set of green full plate armor of a size to fit a person
about half the height of most human warriors.
The armor is made of individual pieces of
green material fastened together, most of which
have the rounded look of scales [green dragonhide
armor, small size, made for a gnome; 1,300 gp].
Below the armor is a short sword in a green
leather sheath. The sword has a bright green
gem [emerald] in the pommel, and the hilt is
wrapped in silver wire over green leather. The
blade itself is dark gray and unadorned [adamantine;
short sword 4,010 gp]. Lying next to the
sword is a matching dagger, though its blade is a
lighter steel gray [masterwork dagger with emerald;
1,107 gp].
Next in the chest is a green leather saddle,
too small to fit even a pony [riding dog saddle; 30
gp] with matching saddlebags [5 gp]. One saddlebag
holds two unlabeled vials [antitoxin; 50 gp
each]. The other contains a green pouch [1 gp] of
coins [70 gp, 95 sp, 86 cp], three gems of various
shades of green [malachite, 10 gp; peridot, 50 gp;
jade, 100 gp] and a tiny green wool bag [2 gp].
Inside the small bag is a silver ring sized to fit a
small finger. On it gleams a large, brilliant green
stone [emerald], cut square [3,250 gp]. [Total
10,130.36 gp]
53-54 Here you find a chaise lounge, made of
white-stained wood and inlaid with ivory and
tiny white pearls. The cushions on the seat and
back of the lounge are white fur [ermine]. The
shades of white match and the whole effect is
one of icy purity [6,000 gp]. Next to it, several
weapons lie on a lumpy red blanket. You see a
scimitar in a gold-plated sheath. The sheath is
plain except for a row of pink gems [rose quartz]
in a line matching the curve of the blade [sheath,
1,000 gp]. The scimitar’s hilt has a curved steel
hand guard decorated with small intricate gold
figures of tigers. The pommel is set with a small,
rich purple gem [corundum]. The blade is a masterwork
of steel with gold swirls wrought into it.
[The gold is superficial and does not weaken the
blade; masterwork scimitar 1,415 gp.] Two
longswords without sheaths, their hilts plain
except for a piece of jet on each [longswords 115
gp each], and four heavy crossbows [30 gp each]
lie beside the scimitar on the red wool blanket [2
gp]. Along the edge of the blanket you see two
greataxes with black iron blades [20 gp each] lie
amid scattered crossbow bolts all dyed red [36
bolts, 1 sp each]. Under the blanket are numerous
items spilled on the floor. There are spools of
gold and silver ribbon [4 spools, each 15 yards
long, 1 gp per yard] that have come unwound and
lie across a pile of hundreds of buttons [1,152
buttons, 5 cp each], several handfuls of gems [54
hematite, 32 lapis lazuli, and 7 eye agates; 10 gp
each], and a pile of coins [56 gp, 892 sp, 3,173
cp]. [Total 10,035.13 gp]

55-56 In the corner, you find a composite longbow
with a quiver of arrows. The bow [100 gp] is a
recurved bow which has layers of black horn on
the front and ash wood in the middle with a
dark black resin on the inside. It is unstrung, its
string lightly tied around the top of the quiver.
Inside the simple leather quiver are twenty
arrows [quiver and arrows, 2 gp]. The arrows are
well made with black shafts and goose-feather
fletching dyed red, with uniformly curved placement
of the fletches that will give the arrow a
definite stabilizing spin in flight. [If the arrows
are individually inspected:] You find the tip of one
arrow seems to be loose and wobbly. [If that
arrow is inspected more closely:] The arrowhead
comes off in your hand, and you discover the
shaft behind it is hollow and stuffed with a bit of
wool wadding. When you remove the wadding,
ten gleaming clear stones [10 diamonds, 1,000 gp
each] tumble out of the hollow in the arrow. [If
the any of the arrows are fired before the special
arrow is found there is a 1 in 20 chance the special
arrow will be launched down range. If the arrow hits
any solid object the shaft will snap and splinter just
behind the arrowhead, scattering the diamonds.]
[Total 10,102 gp]
57-58 Here, seven pedestals stand in a manner that
does not follow any form [meaning they are not
placed in any type of order, such as in a circle or a
square – they are haphazardly placed]. The
pedestals are each about a forearm’s length in
diameter, the height of a short elf, and made of
some white substance. Each pedestal seems to
have a weapon sitting on it. [The Game Master
may want to rule that the pedestals are trapped in
some way to make it more difficult to get the
weapons, or may want to make it so that this room
is found after an exceptionally difficult battle.]
A sickle sits atop the first pedestal. You can
tell as you approach it that this is no normal
weapon, but is a masterfully crafted item [masterwork
, 306 gp]. Next you come to a morningstar
that is just as skillfully crafted [masterwork,
308 gp]. You move to the next pedestal
and find a javelin that seems to have been lovingly
made [masterwork, 301 gp]. Moving to the
next pedestal you see a trident that, like the rest,
is crafted almost perfectly [masterwork, 315 gp].
You move on and discover a heavy flail [masterwork,
315 gp] sitting on the following pedestal,
and you are now sure that every weapon in this
room was created by a master. The pedestal that
you move to next has a hand crossbow sitting on
it, but there are no bolts anywhere to be seen
[masterwork, 400 gp]. You finally make your way
to the last pedestal, which holds a falchion that
is just as impressive as the rest of the weapons in
this room [masterwork, 375 gp].
As you turn to leave, you notice that one of
the pedestals has a small hole in it. You investigate
it to find that it looks as if the hole was created
from some form of blunt force. You notice a
copper coin sitting on the floor just under the
hole. [If someone looks in the hole:] You peek
inside the hole and can see a multitude of copper
coins. [If the group smashes all of the pedestals:]
You smash each pedestal and find hundreds of
thousands of copper coins [770,000 cp]. [Total
10,020 gp]
59-60 You find two wooden wardrobes sitting next
to one another, each taller than a man and
about as wide as two people standing side by side
[400 gp each]. Both are made of ash wood, very
finely joined at the corners, and their doors are
slightly inset; you suspect the wardrobes would
be watertight. The doors are held shut with steel
padlocks, but the locks seem to have been
slightly damaged by being picked at some time
[Amazing locks, 130 gp each].
The inside of each wardrobe is a custommade
padded frame with a human-shaped
alcove in it; the whole frame is lined with purple
velvet. One cupboard holds a richly decorated
suit of full plate armor [masterwork, 7,850 gp],
the other a finely made suit of chainmail [masterwork,
940 gp]. Both suits are fitted onto wooden
dummies [50 gp each], and display the armor
exactly as it would look if worn.
The chainmail suit is accented with a wide
leather sword belt with a silver buckle shaped
like a lion’s head. The lion’s eyes are made of red
garnets. It also has heavy gloves in addition to
its gauntlets; they are made of kid leather dyed
blood red. A small steel plate is attached to the
chest of the chainmail tunic; on it is a motherof-
pearl tree branch, from which hangs a red
garnet apple. Steel leaves covered in lustrous
green enamel are scattered across the tunic and
sleeves.
The suit of plate is made of steel, and gleams
as though freshly polished. Each plate has a line
of gilding around its edges, and the gauntlets,
greaves, breastplate and helm are all quite
ornate. The helm is shaped like a lion’s head,
with gold fangs tipped with red garnets framing
the visor. A gnarled apple tree decorates the
breastplate, with pieces of mother-of-pearl as its
bark and each leaf picked out in gold. A brilliant
emerald in the shape of an apple seems to hang
from a low branch. The suit’s gauntlets and
greaves are covered in enameled leaves, and
each displays a small lion’s head done in gold
with red garnet eyes. [Total 9,950 gp]
table VII: 10,000 gold pieces

61-62 You discover a large ballista [8,000 gp]
beneath a thick layer of garbage. As you brush
aside old, dried onion skins [leaves; pieces of broken
rock and ash; cobwebs] you see the ballista is
in excellent condition, and built of solid oak
with additional supports and fittings of iron.
Also buried beneath the refuse and detritus, you
discover a piece of finely wrought steel horse
barding: a petral [800 gp], fitted to cover a
mount’s chest. The petral is decorated with
lightly rippled fluting, as well as two embossed
elk and what appear to be familial crests.
As you clear away the last of the rubbish, you
discover more items: a shield [125 gp] fashioned
of dragonhide, a leather pack of artisan’s tools
[55 gp], and a thick, well balanced wand with a
smooth emerald tip [1,020 gp]. The shield is
wrought to depict the ornate, stylized, aerial
view of a massive tree; its intertwined boughs
and prodigious bunches of leaves are a work of
art few have seen derived from dragonhide.
The birchwood wand is also a work of simple,
exquisite beauty. Its lines are perfectly straight
but for a few impressions subtly carved into the
rear of the wand, as if to make the grip more
comfortable for the wand’s keeper. Bands of birch
wood are bent tightly around the tip of the wand
before its clear, deep green emerald fitment.
The tool pack is made of leather dyed a deep
greenish blue. Tassels hang from the thick strap
and large pouch, and the satchel looks to be
sized for a human woman to carry. The flap is
held by a unique clasp: a single river shell, spotted
with a brown and cream pattern of dots and
whorls. Opening the flap reveals several expertly
sewn compartments in which masterwork
tools reside. Tucked into one of the compartments
is a tiny note and ink pen. Scrawled in
black ink on the scrap of parchment reads the
following words in common script: “Remember
me, for I lived as do you, and you will someday
go where I have gone.” [Total 10,000 gp]
63-64 You find three hip-high barrels [2 gp each],
with canvas tied on each to cover the openings
[canvas, 3 sp each; twine 1 cp each]. Uncovering
the first barrel, you see about a dozen arm-length
wooden handles, of a size to grip easily in your
hand but becoming wider at the end at the bottom
of the barrel [13 mattock handles; 2 sp each].
The second barrel holds half a dozen mattock
heads, not quite as long as the handles. Each has
a hole in the center where a handle would fit,
with one broad, flat end and the other coming
to a point. They are black and have black dust
flaking off of them. The third barrel holds
another seven heads. [Mattocks were a common
medieval agricultural tool. These mattock heads are
actually made of gold but have been well covered
with soot to hide their material. Each weighs over 15
pounds and is worth 775 gp.] [Total 10,084.53 gp]
the mother of all treasure tables
126
65-66 You come across a slatted pine crate [7 gp] as
long as a coffin and about half that height. One
corner of the crate has been roughly pried open,
as evinced by the loose nails and chipped slats in
the area. The top and sides of the crate near that
corner are covered in dark stains looking suspiciously
like dried blood. Straw is scattered
around the crate, and the sharp smell of pepper
is in the air.
Lifting the pried-up corner of the crate causes
the smell of pepper to intensify. Prying the top
up the rest of the way, you find a bundle of ten
spears. The spears [10 masterwork spears, 322 gp
each] are bound together with thick twine [2 cp],
and each spear’s point is protected by a heavy,
black leather pouch [10 pouches, 2 gp each]. The
shafts of the spears are made of varnished ash
wood, and their butts are covered with studded
steel caps. Thorny vines have been painted
along the shafts, each thorn seemingly tipped
with blood. Their points are broad and roughly
leaf-shaped, made of finely polished steel; they
are affixed to the shafts with bands of steel studded
with brass pyramids. Each spear has two
wire-wrapped handgrips along its shaft, one in
the middle and one down near the butt.
Under the spears, you find several cloth sacks.
When you open one of the sacks [15 sacks, 2 sp
each], you see it is full of peppercorns [50 pounds
of pepper per sack; 2 gp per pound or 100 gp per
sack]. Painted in bright blue on each of the sacks
is a device of three stars over a small fortified
tower, with a pair of bulls locking horns in the
foreground [the symbol of a merchant house, trader
or similar organization].
Under all the pepper, you discover dozens of
gold bars packed in straw [105 bars, one pound
each; 50 gp each]. Each bar is stamped with the
same device as the pepper sacks. [Total
10,000.02 gp]
67-68 Upon entering, your eye is instantly drawn
to a porcelain replica of a basilisk. It stands
about two feet high and is about three feet long.
You approach it and discover it has a rectangular
hole in the very top large enough for any type
of normal coin to drop into it. The statuette is
painted in such detail it almost looks real
[basilisk coin bank, 125 gp]. You examine it further
and find the hole is the only entrance into
the inside of the statue.
Looking in the hole, you can actually see
what look like coins. As a matter of fact, it
appears as if this ‘statue container’ is full of
coins. You can tell you could turn the basilisk
upside down and try to shake the coins out
through the small hole, but it could take hours
to get them all. Your only other option for getting
the coins is to smash the basilisk, which will
of course ruin it. [If the adventurers decide to try to
shake the coins out by turning the basilisk upside
down it will take at least 2 hours to empty it; it
would of course only take seconds to get to the coins
if they smash the statuette. Once the coins are freed
from the container the adventurers will find: 399 pp,
4,225 gp, 10,845 sp].
Turning your attention to other things, you
see a composite longbow [100 gp] propped up
against an old table. Lying on the floor beside
the bow is a quiver of sixty arrows [3 gp]. As you
bend down to pick up the quiver of arrows you
see something out of the corner of your eye.
There seems to be something lodged inside the
under section of the old table. You check underneath
the table and see a masterfully crafted
longsword has been jammed up inside the table.
You give a tug and the sword comes free from its
hiding place [masterwork longsword, 315 gp].
[Total 9,842.5 gp]
69-70 A table of inlaid wood, decorated with
turquoise and lapis lazuli [600 gp], and four
wooden chairs set with turquoise [300 gp each]
catch your eye. A pair of gold goblets, each set
with eight pearls, stand on the table [900 gp
each] with a small hinged brass box [90 gp] with
four white stones [agates] on its lid. Inside the
box you find aromatic dried leaves [snuff or herbs
or something like it, 5 gp].
Next to the table set is a big wooden cabinet
with flat narrow drawers [oak, 100 gp] containing
several maps. There are 24 maps, some obvious
and of nearby or familiar places, some old,
some battered and unrecognizable [value averages
5 gp each].
Stacked beside the map cabinet are 8 barrels
[4 gp each] of rare red wine [250 gp per barrel].
Leaning against the barrels are four halberds and
three greataxes, all well made, plain and sleek
[halberds, 10 gp each; greataxes, 20 gp each].
A narrow cabinet [oak, 75 gp] in the corner
holds five cloaks, three of fine wool [3 gp each],
one from a wolf pelt [25 gp] and one of sable [200
gp]. On the shelf at the top are a pair of dark blue
silk scarves [5 gp each], a pair of black leather
gloves for small hands [8 gp], and two leather
pouches.
One pouch is dark leather with a long strap
for hanging from the shoulder [4 gp]. In it is a
linen handkerchief [1 gp], a broken piece of fine
copper chain [2 sp], a golden pearl pendant on a
delicate gold chain [golden pearl, 600 gp] and two
gold pieces. In a small leather pocket at the back
of the pouch is a single platinum key [5 gp], a
lock pick [2 sp] and a very fine large violet spinel
[750 gp]. The other leather pouch [1 gp] holds
table VII: 10,000 gold pieces
127
numerous coins [25 pp, 215 gp, 890 sp, 1350 cp],
and nine red gems [8 garnets, 100 gp each; 1 ruby,
1000 gp – the ruby looks much like a garnet; DC 29
to tell apart]. [Total 10,104.9 gp]
71-72 You have found a trunk with a hasp and lock
[Average lock; 42 gp]. The lock is closed and no
keys are present. [The lock will surrender to a good
picking or a hefty blow.] Once open, the chest
seems to be filled with drab clothing, folded
nicely [3 artisan’s outfits, 1 gp each; 3 hooded wool
cloaks: brown, black and tan, 1 gp each.] At the
bottom of the chest is a dark red felt bag the size
of a small brick [5 sp]. When the drawstring at
the top of the bag is loosened a silver goblet is
revealed with intricate scrollwork around the
mouth, base and top of the stem [125 gp]. Once
this is removed the chest is empty, its bottom
and sides lined with a very rough-woven heavy
wool fabric.
[A miser has hidden his real treasure in the lining
of his chest. A glint of color might show through the
lining fabric, if a hint is needed. If the adventurers
feel along the bottom of the sides inside the chest:]
The lining feels a bit lumpy along the bottom of
the sides. [If the characters decide to cut the lining
or pull it out of the chest:] Several gems fall into
the bottom of the chest [46 gems in all]. Four
golden yellow gems [topaz, 500 gp each]; five of
pale, clear blue [blue quartz, 10 gp each]; seven
bright blue [lapis lazuli, 10 gp each]; one bluegreen
gem [aquamarine, 500 gp]; nine gold and
brown stones [tigereye, 10 gp each]; ten clear yellow-
green pieces [peridot, 50 gp each]; two medium
purple [amethyst, 100 gp each]; four clear
deep green gems [green spinel, 100 gp each]; two
swirled dark green stones [malachite, 10 gp each];
one deep rich purple gem [purple corundum,
1,000 gp] and a brilliant orange stone [jacinth;
5,000 gp]. [Total 10,003.5 gp]
73-74 You see a giant iron pot [100 gp], coal-black
and sitting on huge claw feet. The pot is taller
than a man of large stature. A rope ladder [10 gp]
hangs down from the pot’s rim. [If a PC climbs up
they get a view of hundreds of rotting turnips. Black
beetles scuttle up through the garbage and crawl lazily
back under.] Next to the huge pot is a large
crate [2 gp] inscribed with a flamboyantly
detailed monogram ‘XZ’. The top of the crate
has already been pried open once and is easily
removed. Within are books finely bound with
rich leather covers [99 blank spellbooks; 15 gp
each]. The covers have a stamped monogram
identical to the one burned onto the crate.
[Three gp have fallen to the bottom of this crate.]
Next to the crate is a large barrel [2 gp], also
with a loose lid. This you discover holds pleasantly
fragrant pale yellow soap [50 pounds; 25
gp]. On the floor behind the barrels lies a
grotesquely exquisite piece of armor: a helmet
[1,000 gp], made of gleaming mithral and jet
black steel. The helmet has a chimerical shape
to it, though it is obviously fitted for a human
man’s head. Twisting horns, fearsome brow
ridges, a scowling expression and snarling lips
are portrayed in the finely wrought metal. The
helmet covers the wearer’s eyes, ears and nose
but leaves the mouth exposed. Long, black
leather straps trail down from the back of the
helmet, giving hints that this helmet, while
quite strong and functional, was made for the
purpose of a parade, festival or tournament.
Similar straps hang down from the helmet’s
pointed ears, and these are also black but tipped
with lurid red tassels.
Further around the side of the pot a glorious
sight catches your eye: an enormous solid gold
tablet [7,120 gp, weight 140 pounds]. The tablet
is resting on several planks of wood, which are
nearly rotten with age and mold. Seven blueviolet
stones [iolite] adorn the ornate relief pattern
decorating the gold slab. The pattern is suggestive
of a constellation in the summer sky. Just
behind the slab of gold is a silver decanter [95
gp] decorated with lavish enamel work. Vibrant
hues of red, indigo and corn yellow are a treat to
the eye, as is the lovely craftsmanship of the
piece. [Total 9,842 gp]
75-76 You find a small, humpbacked chest sitting
next to a leather backpack and a sheathed
sword. The backpack [1 gp] holds a well-worn
traveler’s outfit [1 gp], a skin of good wine [2 gp],
a pair of gold-tipped iron rods [sunrods; 2 gp each]
and a pouch [1 gp] of coins [14 gp, 32 sp, 47 cp].
The longsword is well kept, with the hilt
wrapped in pale leather and bronze wire, and a
large translucent brown stone in the pommel
[smoky quartz, 117 gp]. The chest is bound in
bronze and small enough to be carried under one
arm [2 gp].
Inside, something is wrapped in many layers
of soft, gray wool [6 gp]. As you remove the fabric
from the chest you find a small object, colored
the hue of the setting sun, caught in the
weave of the cloth. On closer inspection you see
it is an ornate, coral carving of a serpent [9,700
gp]. The statue is no bigger than a female elf’s
hand is long, but the detail it exhibits is breathtaking.
Each tiny scale is depicted in perfect
form, and even the serpent’s tongue is shown
poking out from between its minute, deadly
fangs. Some characters are inscribed on the serpent’s
belly [the initials ‘JLB’ in Elven]. [Total
9,851.67 gp]

77-78 A massive wooden throne sits on the floor
before you, dark brown in color and fully twice
the height of a man [9,535 gp]. It looks to have
been carved out of a single piece of wood. The
throne’s four thick legs are widest at their bases,
tapering up into the body of the chair. Each leg
is carved to look like a tree root, and a trunk
with many bare branches – all chased with delicate
silver inlays – is carved in relief up the back
of the throne. Two of these branches actually
project out from the wooden surface, their ends
supporting a gleaming scimitar with an silver
hilt adorned with a deep purple stone [amethyst;
masterwork scimitar, 465 gp]. Peering up at the
sword, you can see many small nicks in the
blade; it has clearly seen heavy use.
Turning your attention back to the throne,
you see heads of orcs and hill giants are carved
among the branches, every face a mask of agony
and defeat. Battle scars and tattoos mark them
as the chiefs of their tribes. Their dead eyes are
picked out with inlaid pearl, and they stare
blankly down at you. The arms of the throne are
carved to look like the arms of a treant, with
thick, twig-like fingers picked out in incredible
detail. Two fingers on each hand wear silver
rings accented with gold, all of which share a
similar design of leafy vines wrapped around a
scimitar. Each ring is set with a small amethyst.
[The rings are part of the throne and cannot be
removed, but could be cut out of the wood; in that
case, each would be worth 175 gp but the value of
the throne would drop by 1,400 gp.] Each hand
grips a wooden shortsword, and the tips of both
swords are skewering an enormous wooden
demon head positioned just below the edge of
the seat The head appears to be carved out of
the same piece of wood as the rest of the throne.
The demon’s eyes are many-faceted topazes
gleaming gold in the light, and each one of its
twelve finger-length teeth is a formed from a
chunk of rose quartz. [Total 10,000 gp]
79-80 This is obviously a place to relax and study
the art of music. There are many different
instruments scattered about. The first one to
catch your eye is a finely crafted harpsichord.
You approach it and press a couple of the keys
and discover it is apparently in tune, as it gives
forth a heavenly sound [masterwork, 1,890 gp;
weighs 250 pounds]. Getting the instrument out
of the room and to a place of safety will be quite
a task.
Looking around you discover smaller, easier
to transport instruments. A lute made of a darkred
wood lies in one corner [masterwork, 120 gp].
A trumpet appearing to be forged from silver
rests on a simple table [masterwork, 160 gp].
Finally, a xylophone is placed at the opposite
end of the room from where the harpsichord
stands [110 gp].
You think you have found all that is of any
worth in this room when you realize that you
have completely ignored a simple wooden desk
[16 gp] holding stacks of paper. When you examine
the paper, you see that it is all thick vellum
with a thin layer of gold trim around the edges.
The papers are covered with musical scores. You
start to read some of the titles of the music here,
and you quickly come to the realization you
have stumbled upon a veritable treasure of rare
and highly sought after classic musical compositions.
There are over one hundred scores and
you can only imagine what they will be worth to
an ardent collector of music [120 rare musical
scores, 65 gp each]. [Total 10,096 gp]
81-82 A gilded chariot [1,235 gp] stands before
you, gleaming in the half-light [sunlight, moonlight,
torch light, near-darkness]. This magnificent
vehicle has been treated well since its acquisition—
even the wheels appeared to have been
oiled at some point. The large wheels are as high
as a woman is tall, and the base of the cart has
no seat, only a thick plank of mahogany upon
which the charioteer would stand surrounded by
gilded rails.
Beyond the chariot there are other items of
interest. You see a large, covered wooden cart, of
the size which could be pulled by one sturdy
horse or two strong ponies. The poles of the cart
are set on blocks and chunks of boulder, as if to
keep the vehicle steady. The cart’s cover, which
is divided into two segments, once had a fine
lock, but it now lies blackened and ruined on
the floor looking like it was blasted off. When
you open the hinged, wooden cover you discover
this is actually a portable lab for a master
alchemist [2,000 gp]. With the exception of one
large glass vial, none of the other equipment
appears cracked or harmed in any way.
Suddenly you see the object behind the cart,
although hidden beneath copious amounts of
filthy hempen cloth [4 square yards, 5 cp per
square yard], has a distinctly bestial shape. With
trepidation you remove the cloth and discover a
remarkably well preserved stuffed winter wolf
[300 gp], replete with luxuriant fur, two life-like
glass eyes, white, dagger-like fangs and black,
snarling lips.
Beside this display of masterful taxidermy is
another, slightly taller draped figure. Pulling the
hempen cloth [8 square yards, 5 cp per square
yard] from this object reveals a preserved, stuffed
male unicorn [5,000 gp], horn intact. The unicorn’s
right front hoof is raised as if in defense
table VII: 10,000 gold pieces
129
and its proud nostrils are flared. The taxidermist
has replicated the creature’s expression with
alarming realism, even to the whites of the
beast’s rolled-back eyes.
Beyond this disturbing treasure sits a more
mundane item: a large bowl of carved onyx
[1,465 gp], the hues of which begin with a deep
copper at its base and move on to sandier shades
of brown before ending in creamy, alabaster
white at its rim. [Total 10,000.6 gp]
83-84 A large piece of gray canvas [2 gp] covers a
pile on the floor. Under the canvas you first
notice an axe, a set of mail and a gray backpack.
The axe is much larger than standard, its single,
wide blade balanced by protrusions on the other
side of the haft. Silver wire wraps the handle,
over some strange gray leather. The blade
appears extremely sharp and the whole looks
very well made [masterwork dwarven waraxe, 330
gp]. Propped up next to it is a light steel shield [9
gp], which leans on piled chainmail. The armor
is in good condition, and also well made [masterwork
chainmail, 300 gp]. Examination shows it
is made for a person significantly shorter and
huskier than the average human male [sized for a
dwarf].
The backpack [6 gp] is large, with several covered
outer pockets, and made of the same gray
leather wrapping the handle of the axe. [This
leather is from some unspecified subterranean creature.]
One large outside pocket contains a rolled
cloth full of ointments, bandages and herbs
[healer’s kit, 50 gp]. Another has a strong pair of
manacles and a complex lock [masterwork manacles,
50 gp; Amazing lock, 150 gp]. In one small
side pocket is a waxed pouch [1 gp] holding a
spicy brown powder [cinnamon, 1 pound; 1 gp]. A
pocket on the opposite side holds a scrap of
leather [1 cp] wrapped around a rough, gray
stone with runes engraved on its surface [thunderstone,
30 gp]. When you open the pack, you
find a heavy, oiled cloak rolled and strapped to
the inside of the top flap. Below it, a rust-stained
wool tunic [1 sp] hides the rest of the contents.
By the markings, it was worn under the mail. A
leather packet holds all the gear needed for
climbing in steep mountains, or perhaps underground
[climber’s kit, 80 gp]. Along one corner of
the pack is something wrapped in cloth. It
proves to be two linen shirts [5 sp each], wrapped
around a slender recorder in two pieces that fit
together to produce an instrument longer than
most you have seen [tenor recorder; 5 gp]. Beside
it is a fat leather bag tied tightly at the top. [The
bag is filled with some type of sticky substance that
becomes rubbery on top when exposed to air; tanglefoot
bag, 50 gp]. Underneath it is a heavy wool
shirt, a thick sheepskin jacket with the fleece on
the inside, heavy leather pants, two pairs of
thick woolen socks and a pair of warm gloves
[with the oiled cloak, a cold weather outfit; 8 gp]. At
the very bottom of the pack are a few lumpy
things. The largest is a block and tackle [5 gp],
while another is a fat sack [1 sp] of coins [2 gp,
187 sp, 486 cp]. The last item is a heavy leather
belt pouch [1 gp]. Inside this, wrapped in soft
linen [1 gp], are two items of silver jewelry. One
is a linked bracelet, with three sizes and shapes
of gleaming red stones [garnets; bracelet, 608 gp].
The other is a necklace, with those same deep
red gems [garnets] set between unusual, large
oval pearls set in silver [necklace, 8,414 gp]. A
heavy pick [8 gp] lies beneath the backpack.
[Total 10,135.77 gp]
85-86 You see a tapestry [1,200 gp] draped over several
large objects, with a few gold coins peeking
out around the edges. The tapestry itself is as
large as the wall of a small cottage, and depicts a
tale of courtship between an elven woman and a
satyr, which begins on the left side with them
falling in love and ends on the right with the elf
dying of grief after the satyr runs off with a faerie
woman.
Moving aside the tapestry, you can now see
what it was covering: three large chairs [800 gp
each], a dresser [800 gp], a small chest made of
horn and ivory [450 gp], a stack of three crates [5
sp each] and a tall candelabrum [75 gp]. Coins
[162 gp, 550 sp, 500 cp] are scattered all over the
floor among the various objects, apparently having
spilled from something. One crate has a hole
in its side and turns out to be empty, while the
other two are full of mixed coinage [172 gp, 412
sp, 496 cp; 158 gp, 593 sp, 404 cp].
The chairs are made of dark wood and upholstered
in threadbare red velvet. Their legs and
arms have a bit of scrollwork carved into them,
but most of the decoration has been saved for
their headrests, each of which boasts a relief
carving of a bear and a large snake locked in
mortal combat. The bear’s eyes are sparkling red
gems [red spinels], while the snake’s fangs are
picked out in silver pearls.
Between the chairs and the dresser is a candelabrum
twice as high as a halfling. Thirty-two
candleholders are arranged in a ring at the top,
and the whole assemblage is made of tarnished
brass. Each candleholder is carved in the shape
of a tulip blossom.
The dresser stands a bit higher than a dwarf,
and is made of pale wood; parts of it have been
painted a delicate silver color. Red vines run
around the face of each of its six drawers, and a
lustrous pink pearl is the centerpiece of each
the mother of all treasure tables
drawer handle. All of the drawers are empty save
the top one, which holds an ivory comb in the
shape of a dragon [60 gp], two bone hairpins
carved as rapiers [2 gp each] and a pair of gold
earrings [pair, 3,400 gp]. The earrings each feature
a stunning fire opal, from which dangles a
small black star sapphire.
At the foot of the dresser sits the small ivory
and horn chest, barely the size of a loaf of bread.
It is raised off the ground an inch or so on tiny
horn legs, and the lid can be lifted with a handle
made from a single twisted horn. Three trees
are carved into the top of the lid, which is made
of ivory: a young tree with very few leaves, an
older tree with many leaves, and an ancient tree
with no leaves, with a hanged man dangling
from one of its branches. The inside of the chest
is lined with thickly-padded white velvet, and
nestled therein is a small dagger [masterwork,
1,102 gp]. The dagger’s handle and narrow crosspiece
are made of silver, and there is a hole in
the base of the blade. A black pearl is set into
that hole, held in place by a delicate web of
gold. [Total 10,154 gp]
87-88 A mass of gold [9,127 gp; 182 pounds] is
spilled over a wooden box and something
leather. The tip of a wooden bow protrudes from
the pile. Pulling it out, you see it is a longbow,
crafted of darkwood. Thin spirals and loops of
silver are chased along its length [masterwork;
465 gp]. Found among the gold is a set of leather
armor, sized for a large man. This is obviously
the work of a master [masterwork, 180 gp], and is
traced with slender silver lines, which match
those of the bow.
Underneath the pile is a polished wooden
box, as long as a man’s arm-span, a forearm’s
length tall and about as deep, which closes with
a lock [Average lock; box 46 gp]. Inside, a padded
frame holds a silvery trumpet, long and slender
with an elegant flared bell [masterwork, 100 gp].
The frame is made to hold a second trumpet
lying in the opposite direction, but it is missing.
In its place lies a scroll tube [1 gp] which opens
to reveal several sheets of paper in a roll.
Unrolling the batch, you see the top sheet is
illuminated. It has vines and leaves drawn with
green ink, twirling around a thin border of real
gold. Each sheet is decorated similarly [27 pages;
3 gp each]. [Total 10,000 gp]
89-90 Here you find four shortbows [30 gp each] of
yellow wood, their grips wrapped with red
leather. Beside them are two quivers, each with
twenty arrows [quivers with arrows, 1 gp each].
The quivers are made from yellow-dyed leather
and the arrows are yellow wood, fletched with
red-dyed feathers. A dark wooden box with
lighter wood inlays and brass fittings [5 gp] is
locked with a complex padlock [Good lock; 80
gp]. Inside you find many small items: a pair of
small ivory dice [2 gp], twenty gold hairpins [1 gp
each], a cylindrical gold box [8 gp] containing a
dozen toothpicks carved of ivory [1 sp each], a silver
chain with a tourmaline pendant [125 gp],
and a brooch of silver with five fine purple
stones [amethyst; brooch, 550 gp]. There are four
rolls of silk ribbon in red, black, orange and
green [10 yards each; 5 sp per yard] and a pair of
delicate gold earrings set with tiny clear diamonds
[pair, 2,500 gp]. In the bottom of the box
are a number of loose lapis lazuli beads [26 beads,
10 gp each], a handful of clear rock crystal beads
[11 beads, 50 gp each], and several thousand coins
[174 gp, 993 sp, 8,244 cp]. A shoulder bag [2 gp]
holds a heavy copper chain with a holy symbol
[to a forest deity] made of petrified wood set in a
disk of platinum [41 gp], and a padded leather
carrying case covered with vine and leaf tooling
[case, 5 gp] holds a fine, cut crystal bottle [5 gp]
filled with a clear liquid [holy water, 25 gp].
Under the shoulder bag is a box, a hand’s
breadth deep and less than a forearm square, polished
and decorated with alternating squares of
deep red [carnelian] and bright, light blue-green
stone [chrysoprase; box, 2,500 gp]. The box holds
a drawer of carved game pieces in the same two
stones [chess or a similar game; 20 playing pieces of
each color, 70 gp each]. [Total 9,976.94 gp]
91-92 Six large coffins sit in a row in one corner;
the lid of one of the coffins is off, resting on edge
against another coffin. All of the coffins are
sized for humans or elves; three are jet black in
color [it is one of these that is open], two are made
of rich mahogany wood, and the sixth appears to
be cut from a single piece of stone.
Upon closer examination, you see the stone
coffin [4,400 gp] is indeed made from a single
enormous piece of granite; its heavy lid sits flush
with the body of the coffin, and the joint
between them is so fine as to be almost invisible.
The sides of the coffin are unadorned, but the
lid features a life-sized relief carving of a beautiful
human woman. Each of her eyes is a many
faceted ruby, and she is dressed in sumptuous
robes covered in runes [symbols of a wizards’
guild]. Levering off the lid of the coffin [probably
with great difficulty, as it weighs 300 pounds on its
130
table VII: 10,000 gold pieces
131
own], you find it to be completely empty – the
interior is spotless, and has clearly never held a
body.
The jet-black coffins are made of laminated
strips of heartwood, hundreds per coffin, and
polished to a high shine. The coffins are put
together without any nails, and are clearly the
work of a master artisan. The sides of the first
coffin [1,700 gp] document the life of an elven
noble, beginning at the head of the coffin. With
figures barely a finger’s length in height, the narrative
wraps around the coffin twice, telling a
tale of the elf’s rise to power in the court, his fall
from grace and his eventual murder. The second
coffin [1,400 gp] is decorated in the same way,
except it only takes one trip around the sides of
the coffin to tell the tale of this elven woman,
who patrolled the borders of her forest kingdom
her entire life before being slain by a tribe of
orcs. The third coffin is completely unadorned
[1,000 gp], although the workmanship is no less
exceptional. All three have plain lids; all three
are empty.
The two mahogany coffins [600 gp each] are a
matched pair: an old man is painted on the lid
of the first one, looking to his right; an old
woman is painted on the other coffin, looking to
her left, towards the man. Both are dressed in
simple pale green robes and ankle-high leather
sandals. Scores of tiny bottles, all containing
what may be spell components, are around their
feet. Their hands and faces are a mass of wrinkles,
but their eyes flash brightly and they both
wear slightly secretive smiles. [These are servants
in the same wizards’ guild as the woman seen on the
lid of the stone coffin.] One coffin is empty, but
the other contains a leather sack [2 gp] of coins
[180 gp, 1,200 sp] and a set of woodworker’s
tools [masterwork, 55 gp]. [Total 10,057 gp]
93-94 You see a large shape, easily the height of a
large man and twice the width, draped in rotted,
moldy linen [no value]. Pulling away the cloth
causes it to disintegrate in a fine, aggravating
dust which coats the items it was hiding in a
gray, dingy film. You discover the odd shape was
due to the number of large items hidden under
the rotted cloth. The tallest of them seems to be
a block of wood as tall as a man, but it has been
carved almost as if it were stone, showing a
mountain woodland scene of incredible detail
[petrified wood, 300 gp]. It seems as if the artisan’s
tools captured each needle of every fir tree, and
a forest is shown marching up the mighty flanks
of the snow-capped mountain. Half-hidden
among the first line of trees is a large house with
myriad eaves and chimneys.
Next to the block of wood stands a silver harp
as high as a man’s chest. Its clean, simple lines
refresh the eye, and its strings, when plucked,
still produce lovely, clear notes [masterwork harp,
wood covered with silver; 834 gp]. Beside the harp
stands an ornate, almost gaudy statue of solid
gold [3,750 gp], portraying an elven maiden surrounded
by a garden of snapdragons and climbing
roses. Birds nest in her hair and rest upon
her fingers, and her lips purse as if captured in
song. A tiny garden snake coils around her bare
ankle, and her clothing bespeaks riches beyond
a commoner’s means.
Also among the larger objects is a wooden
barrel [2 gp] in good condition. It is easy work to
pry open the lid; when you do, you see the barrel
holds pure, vivid yellow powder [saffron; 60
pounds, 900 gp]. Tiny clouds of it blow up into
the air when you open the barrel’s lid. Lying
upon the spicy-smelling powder is a linen sack [2
sp] holding three other, smaller pieces of treasure:
two belt fitments [65 gp] of pure, fine gold
and a gilded ram’s horn with mother of pearl and
onyx inlay [2,990 gp]. The belt fitments are fashioned
to resemble artisan’s tools, in a guild symbol
of crossed hammer and chisel.
Finally, on the floor behind the barrel you discover
a beautiful leather hunting bag [5 gp], one
which surely must have been cherished by its
former owner. A scene is depicted in fine tooling
and rich dye work, of a rider on horseback hunting
a large buck. The leather is soft, but strong,
and the bag has several pockets and compartments
for storing various items. Most of them
are empty, but one contains a small leather purse
[1 gp] which holds a handful of coins [2 pp, 12
gp, 17 sp] and two black pearls [500 gp each].
[Total 9,945.9 gp]
95-96 You find a suit of strange, coppery armor. It is
banded armor, but instead of steel seems to be
made of large, copper-colored scales [dragonhide
armor; 800 gp]. Nearby lies a matching shield,
with that same copper material over a base of
wood [dragonhide; 314 gp]. A leather baldric [2
gp] holds a sheathed scimitar and dagger, and a
sling is tucked under a loop. The sling is made of
an unusual leather with a coppery sheen, and
matches both the shield and the armor [dragonhide;
10 gp]. The scimitar is lighter than you
would expect. Its glistening, silvery blade
[mithral] sets off the pair of deep blue jewels [deep
blue spinels] on either side of the hilt where it
joins the crosspiece [3,015 gp]. The dagger also
has a silvery blade, with a matching blue jewel
on the pommel [silvered, not mithral; 522 gp].
Next to the piled armor is a huge canvas bag
[8 gp], perhaps even large enough to hold a
grown man. [If the adventurers try to move the
the mother of all treasure tables
132
bag:] It is extremely heavy and you hear the
clank of iron on iron as the contents shift. Inside
are two huge iron circles which fasten at a giant
lock. You suddenly realize what they must be—
a pair of manacles, obviously meant to hold
something much larger than a normal human.
Either that, or they could be used to chain two
husky men together at the waist! Not only are
these manacles enormous, they are of superb
quality with an excellent lock [Huge masterwork
manacles with Amazing lock, 5,150 gp]. [Total
9,821 gp]
97-98 You find four travel trunks stacked in a haphazard
pile. They are all roughly an armspan in
length with pairs of handles at both ends, and
none are locked.
Two of the trunks are made of pungent cedar
wood covered with travel-worn green leather;
their corners are protected by dented brass caps
[15 gp each]. Both trunks are full of clothes. In
one, you find five purple and black royal outfits
sized for a human man [200 gp each] and five
matching royal outfits sized for a human woman
[200 gp each]. Beneath the clothes you find a
dagger with a solid silver handle [masterwork,
372 gp] and a book carefully wrapped in waxed
cloth. The book is titled On the Wickedness of
Gnomes, and from the dented corners and creases
along its spine you would guess it has been
read many times [200 gp to a collector].
The second cedar trunk holds a half-dozen
silk capes with fur collars, ranging from black to
bright blue in color [50 gp each], as well as two
sets of elaborate fur-lined hunting clothes [cold
weather outfits, but with finer materials; 108 gp
each]. Laid beneath the hunting outfits are two
heavy crossbows [masterwork, 500 gp each] and
ten boxes of bolts [masterwork, 10 bolts per box;
61 gp per box]. The crossbows are a matched pair,
with stocks featuring ivory carvings of mounted
nobles hunting horned, demonic-looking
gnomes, and their sights are picked out in silver
with gold accents. They are superbly balanced.
The next trunk in the stack is made of bloodred
wood [8 gp]. It holds a few sacks with a mix
of gold and silver coins [776 gp, 2,300 sp total]
and some slender gold bars [7 bars, each weighing
1 pound, 50 gp each]. The gold bars are stamped
with the symbol of a cracked knight’s shield
devoid of any heraldry [perhaps the mark of a
thieves’ or assassins’ guild].
Inside the fourth trunk, which is banded with
iron [8 gp], you find five small barrels, all padded
and held apart from one another by thick layers
of cloth batting. Four of them are branded with
the word ‘wine’ in Common, while the fifth barrel
is branded with the word ‘godswater.’ [The
first four barrels hold magewine, a rare beverage
brewed by ogre magi, 350 gp each; the fifth barrel
holds the equivalent of 100 flasks of holy water,
2,500 gp] [Total 10,000 gp]
99-100 A large wooden chest [2 gp] looking as if it
has seen better days sits at the foot of an oldfashioned
bed. It opens easily and the first thing
you see is a flowing white dress which may be a
wedding dress. It is linen with pearls sewn onto
it along the neckline and down the front and
the back [6,574 gp]. Lifting the dress carefully
out of the chest reveals a small wooden box [1
gp] and a pair of white shoes with pearls sewn
onto the tops [520 gp]. Obviously someone has
kept her wedding dress and shoes here, possibly
as a keepsake.
You lift the box out of the chest and open it.
Inside you find a ring and nine small gold bars
[each about three inches long, two inches wide and a
half inch thick]. Each bar has an ornate letter
expertly etched into it. The letters are A, E, D,
R, D, I, A, N and N [the gold bars are meant to be
placed side by side to form the name Addrianne –
each gold bar weighs 5 pounds and is worth 250 gp].
The ring is a platinum band with a deep reddishpurple
stone [alexandrite], possibly a wedding
ring [600 gp]. [Total 9,947 gp]
table VII: 10,000 gold pieces

How are we going to carry all this
stuff?
All sets are valued at 30,000 gold pieces plus or minus
2%, or in other words 29,400 to 30,600 gp. The italicized
text contains values and information reserved for the
game master. In general, the GM will not immediately
read this text to the players; it is there for the GM to use
as he or she sees fit.
Roll d20 and use the indicated set:
01 Amidst a pile of longswords [8 at 10 gp each],
battleaxes [2 at 6 gp each], and some spears, most
of which are broken [four intact shortspears are 4
gp each], there sit six great oaken chests [35 gp
each] with iron fastenings. Three large rings on
each side allow them to be carried. Leaning
against the first chest are two high quality
longswords [masterwork, 315 gp each] and a short
sword [masterwork, 310 gp] in leather scabbards
of black, green, and red respectively. Each scabbard
is on a leather belt with brass buckles and
wrought silver stamped disks [75 gp each]. The
disks alternate a plain disk with one stamped
with a falcon on one belt, with a fox on another
belt, and with a tree on the third.
Upon opening the first chest you see it is
piled with gold [6,640 gp] and on the huge mass
of coins lie a gold and jet wristlet with a falcon
design [3,060 gp], a belt and various leather
items. The belt is made of oval brass links, hung
across the front with a chain of faceted beads of
glass in a variety of colors, sizes and shapes,
interspersed with decorative metal beads, and
further hung with dangling metal disks in various
sizes of silver [or tin], copper and brass [150
gp]. Near it are three strips of leather with silver
studs [50 gp each], long enough to stretch from
the wrist to fingertips, which seem to have been
cut from horse bridles of black, red, and green
leather. Five gleaming, sharp daggers [masterwork,
302 gp each] in leather scabbards [three red,
one black, and one green], also sit upon the pile of
coins. In addition there are three pairs of gloves.
One is a pair of worn green gloves [1 sp] while
another is a fine black pair with a red leather falcon
appliquéd upon the broad cuffs [1 gp]. A
very fine pair of small red gloves would allow for
fine manipulation [1 gp].
The second chest also holds gold [7,200 gp],
and two belt pouches [2 gp]. One is black leather
with a buttoned flap that has an appliquéd red
falcon upon it. This pouch contains a pearl
necklace [2,500 gp] and a silver wristlet of twisted
chain [650 gp]. Also inside is a bracelet: a
ruby-eyed silver fox design on a flat band of gold
is joined into a bracelet by a fine gold chain
[2,500 gp] which has four charms on it—a silver
tree, a piece of amber etched with a falcon, a silver
disk bearing a “T” rune and a gold disk bearing
a lion [charms, 125 gp each]. You also find
three plain gold rings, and two matching gold
bands which appear to be a set for a male and
female [5 rings, 250 gp each]. There is also a ring
in this pouch with a black onyx stone in it supported
by a swirling gold wire design [1,200 gp],
and 24 gold coins. The other pouch is of a fine
green-dyed calf hide and is well-oiled [2 gp]. It
appears to be a type of pouch which lies flat to
have items placed in it and is then rolled up and
bound with a cord. When the pouch is unrolled
it is found to contain a set of well made thieves’
tools with each tool in its own pocket [masterwork
thieves’ tools, 100 gp]. Two of the other
chests contain silver coins, and two contain
copper [6,610 sp, 6,680 sp, 6,725 cp, 7,172 cp].
[Total 30,391.07 gp]
02 Carefully placed on a large piece of heavy black
wool cloth [3 yards by 4 yards, 48 gp], you find an
enormous solid silver mirror [18,000 gp], a water
clock [1,500 gp], a silver spyglass mounted on a
tall stand [5,000 gp] and a square chest [500 gp]
overflowing with silver pieces [44,520 sp].
The mirror is oval-shaped and stands as high
as a horse’s shoulder; at its widest point, the mirror
is as wide as a man’s arm is long. It is mounted
on a four-legged stand allowing it to pivot in
the center. The ends of each leg are carved to
look like dragon’s claws, ending in wicked points
dimpling the cloth on which the mirror is sitting.
The frame of the mirror is as wide as a
halfling’s palm, and every inch of it is covered in
silver leaf. The lower half of the frame is carved
to look like a windswept sea, while the upper
half is covered in storm-tossed clouds.
Raindrops, each made of a teardrop-shaped
piece of aquamarine, dot the upper portion of
the border.
The mirror’s glass is flawless, backed with a
thin sheet of silver, reflecting your faces perfectly.
Examining the back, you see it is covered
with a painting of a large black dragon. The
Table VIII:
30,000 Gold Pieces
134
dragon’s tail coils around itself as it winds
around the frame, and its eyes (as well as many
of its scales) are set with tiny bloodstones. The
dragon is beautifully painted and exceptionally
lifelike; it clutches a human skull in each of its
fore claws.
The water clock sits on a marble pedestal, and
a piece of chrysoberyl is set into the center of its
face. It is currently empty [the clock requires water
to tell time], but appears to be in perfect working
order [which it is]. Each number on its face is
made of a tiny mosaic of multicolored chips of
marble, and all of its tiny gears are of brightly
polished brass.
Next to the clock sits the spyglass on its tripod.
The legs of the tripod are made of polished
cherry wood and capped with brass, and each is
covered in stylized carvings of stars. The body of
the spyglass is made of solid silver, and its surface
is delicately etched with different constellations.
The stars which comprise each constellation are
picked out with inlaid gold, and three of the
brightest stars are marked by pieces of golden
topaz.
Surrounded by small heaps of silver coins, the
chest stands off to one side from the other
objects. It is made of oak, with inlays of ivory
and white pine. Its curved lid bears a carving of
a manor house, the windows of which are made
of mother-of-pearl. There is a tower at one end
of the manor house, and it looks as though it
once had a figure standing atop it. That portion
of the tower has been chipped away, though,
leaving gouges in the wood; only the figure’s feet
remain. [Total 29,500 gp]
03 Here you can see eight barrels, a strongbox, and
a sturdy sack, lying on a pile of colorful cloth.
There are four barrels [2 gp each] of fine red wine
[200 gp each; equal to twenty bottles]. Four similar
barrels are packed with straw and contain a table
setting for 24 people. Two barrels hold the
plates: they are gold with enamelled pictures,
each with different scenes of people and animals
in the countryside [100 gp each], and there are
three smaller matching plates for each set, with
the pictures related but not identical [72 plates,
70 gp each].
The next barrel holds cut crystal goblets set
with rings of gold, top and bottom [24 of each;
large goblet, 150 gp; small, 120 gp]. In the final
barrel are 24 ebony-handled steel eating knives,
set with smoky or rose quartz [55 gp each], 24
two-tined gold forks, each with smoky quartz or
star rose quartz in the handles [65 gp each] and
24 golden soup spoons with small alexandrite or
aquamarines in the handles [350 gp each]. Also
rolled up in the barrel are 24 pure white silk
napkins, each elaborately embroidered in white
silk [10 gp each] and 24 plain gold napkin rings
[10 gp each].
A strong box of iron-reinforced wood sits
nearby, locked with a heavy padlock [Good lock,
45 gp] contains thousands of coins, neatly organized
[503 gp, 321 sp, 7,438 cp]. A woolen sack
beside it holds eight jewelled daggers, identical
except for the gem in the hilt: two each of
bloodstone, moonstone, onyx, and violet-blue
iolite [55 gp each].
Under the sack is a stack of woven cloth [silk,
13 various colors and patterns, 5 yards each; 10 gp
per yard] and a gold statue of a fertility goddess,
taller than your outstretched hand, with fine
golden gems for eyes [topaz; statue 2,000 gp]. A
heavy black mace [12 gp], a well made pair of
arm-length shears [for pruning trees, 5 gp], four
horseman’s composite shortbows, painted black
[75 gp each] and four score black arrows [1 gp each
score] in four quivers [2 gp each] are in the shadows
behind the barrels. [Total 30,561.48 gp]
04 In front of you is a set of seven standing lanterns
[350 gp set], graduated in size from a foot to
knee-high in height. Each is a half foot square,
made of rather thin iron with square glass panels.
One pane is on a hinged door, through
which the lantern can be filled and lit. Nearby is
a horse-high pole of oak, once well polished but
now rather worn on its lower half. It is topped
with a silver cap which supports a large tarnished
silver crescent sculpture [1,200 gp].
There is also a masterfully carved rectangular
wooden table of deep rich color with a circle surmounted
by two outward facing crescents on
each of the sides. The legs are twisted to form a
spiral which ascends from the floor to the table
[360 gp].
To one side sits an elegantly made chest of
black wood with silver fastenings [masterwork,
375 gp] that holds first half a dozen items
wrapped in fine black silk [6 pieces, 2 gp each].
The first ones are two very fine silver candlesticks
[250 gp each] each about as long as a tall
man’s forearm. You also find a crescent-shaped
dish of silver [320 gp], a ceremonial silver dagger
with a black star sapphire in the pommel [1,360
gp], two vials of holy water [25 gp each], and a
finely polished black ebony stick [suitable for
enchanting; 300 gp] nearly as thick as a woman’s
small finger and about as long as a woman’s arm
might be from elbow to fingertip. Below these
are two book covers of black leather bound over
thin wood. The front piece is decorated with a
large silver crescent on the front and tiny scintillating
gems creating the appearance of stars
[1,800 gp]. The back has a large silver disk and
table VIII: 30,000 gold pieces
135
the same star-like design [2,000 gp]. There is no
trace of the book they held. Twelve more sets of
covers decorated in star-like patterns like the
signs of the zodiac also have no internal pages
[1,270 each set].
Next is a wooden box [15 gp] with a broken
ring that may have once allowed a padlock to
fasten the hasp shut has a small slit in the top
into which coins can be dropped. The box contains
a hefty mix of coins [339 gp, 59 sp, 620 cp].
A soft black leather pouch [2 gp] is also present.
It contains thirteen silver rings each decorated
with a thirteen-pointed star [220 gp each], thirteen
silver crescent cloak clasps [100 gp each]
and thirteen large silver pentagram pendant
holy symbols [125 gp each]. [Total 30,020.1 gp]
05 This pile of treasure is dominated by four large
metal screens. Scenes of a storm and rain deity
[or brilliant lightning in a thunderstorm] in silver,
gold and gems [each has: 5 zircons, 6 rock crystals,
7 garnets, 4 turquoise] make sumptuous, sparkling
panels [1,500 gp each]. Crumpled by them are
five wall-hanging sized dark yellow silk rectangles,
embroidered and gemmed. [Each hanging
has 3 blue quartz, 2 red quartz, 2 carnelians, 2
ambers, and 1 amethyst and is worth 750 gp.] Six
spears [2 gp each] and four red silk pennons with
yellow designs [possibly local heraldry; 4 gp each]
lie behind the cloths. Beside them, two statues
rest atop a pile of furs. The larger statue is polished
copper, of a woman brandishing a jewelled
platinum sword [with 2 zircons and 2 onyx; local
goddess, 300 gp]. The second is a fierce deity,
made of gold decorated with rubies and emeralds
[6 each], holding a fire opal in its hand [statue
14,500 gp]. The furs are ten beaver pelts [4 gp
each], eighteen minks [50 gp each] and four silver
fox [75 gp each]. A handaxe [6 gp] and a woodcutter’s
greataxe [20 gp] lie upon a large sack.
The sack [2 sp] contains four golden salvers [100
gp each], a slender silver candle holder [5 gp], a
gold censer [burns incense; 125 gp], a bundle of
tall beeswax candles, partly burned [27 candles, 5
sp each] and sixteen pieces of incense [2 gp each].
Under them are six yellow silk robes, slightly
bloodstained [5 gp each]. Below those, a brass
bowl [4 sp] holds coins, mostly coppers [23 gp, 82
sp, 455 cp]. A smaller pouch [1 gp] contains a
broken string of beads [amber, 23 pieces; 120 gp
each] and a silver holy symbol on a copper chain
[chain 5 sp]. The holy symbol [of a storm god] has
a complex design and five fine smoky quartz
[symbol 550 gp]. Finally you find four large copper
bowls [3 gp each], two miniature barrels of ale
[9 sp each], and a large leather sack [1 gp] stuffed
with big, wax-covered cheeses [6 cheeses, 10
pounds each; 2 gp each]. [Total 29,824.15 gp]
06 You find a bed of glittering and sparkling coins,
strewn rather haphazardly across the floor in a
sea of gold and silver, copper and platinum [148
pp, 2,317 gp, 11,042 sp, 8,914 cp—all minted
from the same kingdom]. Tossed upon these odd
waters is a large seaman’s chest, made from
strong dark wood banded in gold and silver and
sparkled with a variety of gemstones [5 amber, 5
red garnet, and a single black pearl; chest 1,685 gp].
The front of the chest has a visage carved into
it, that of an older, serene male. [This can be any
figure the GM decides or just a random carving.]
Within the chest you find an exquisitely
crafted dinner set of six plates, knives, forks and
spoons fit for a king. Each one is covered with
gold and the pieces of cutlery are each ornamented
with a deep blue gem [blue spinels; set
5,400 gp]. There are also two large spheres of a
blue-white crystal [blue quartz, 8,000gp each].
Each sphere could be grasped with one hand,
but they are heavy enough to be awkward to
hold in this manner. One is carved with iconic
images of sea battles and shows a fleet of ships
[corsair or pirate vessels] fighting. The second
sphere is carved with a series of continents and
land masses, and there are smaller lines that run
all over the globe. Upon closer inspection you
see the sphere even has the cardinal points of a
compass carved into it, along with bearings and
other nautical markings. [These could be trade
routes or the whole globe could be a map to a bigger
hoard.]
Finally, lying partially submerged in the mass
of coinage outside of the chest you find a twohanded,
broad bladed sword of fine and robust
construction, polished to a mirror-bright sheen.
The centerpiece of this weapon seems to be the
finely detailed hilt made from gold carved in the
shape of a dragon with wings outstretched. The
head’s open jaws disgorge the blade, with a small
amount of detail near the mouth inscribed in a
flame-like pattern, and two blue gemstones [sapphires]
for its eyes [masterwork greatsword; 2,500
gp]. [Total 30,575.34 gp]
07 The room is dominated by a large, painted sarcophagus
resting on a plinth. It is made of a dark
hardwood and is longer than even a very tall
human. Its tall sides depict the events of an
adventurous life while the lid shows the features
of an armed and armored man in his middle
years, presumably the occupant. Small gems
[various colored spinels] dot the lid. The entire
coffin is old, perhaps centuries, but is still in
excellent condition [entire piece; 3,500 gp]. The
lid opens with a groan and a puff of dust revealing
a shallow compartment with a golden burial
mask depicting the face and upper torso of a
the mother of all treasure tables
136
powerful man [7,500 gp]. The mask features
inlays of a deep blue stone [lapis lazuli] and shiny
black glass [obsidian]. It is incredibly heavy and
difficult to move. You also see a series of four
ceramic jars about the length of a human forearm.
These are beautifully painted with pastoral
scenes and capped with gold stoppers [jars, 50 gp
each]. Unstopping a jar fills the air with a heady
perfume [scented oil, 25 gp per jar].
Whoever was once laid to rest in this sarcophagus
is gone; no evidence of a body remains.
Fortunately, the lack of a corpse reveals the obvious
false bottom in the coffin. It moves easily,
uncovering a large space below filled with a lake
of coins: copper and silver make up the bulk, but
bits of gold and platinum shine through as well
[1,121 pp; 3,610 gp; 7,688 sp; 14,572 cp; from
many different kingdoms]. Awash in the coins is
what appears to be the equipment of the warrior
on the lid: a greatsword [masterwork, 350 gp], a
composite longbow [masterwork, +4 strength
bonus; 800 gp], and a suit of full plate armor
which needs cleaning [masterwork; 1,650 gp].
Beneath the armor is a small golden box decorated
with details of a woodland scene [50 gp]. It
is empty, but apparently once held something of
value. The interior is padded and lined with soft
felt, with spacers set at the width of a typical
flask. Pawing through the coins reveals two additional
items; a beautiful walking stick with an
elaborate gold head [100 gp] and an alabaster
statue of a cat [50 gp]. [Total 30,034.52 gp]
08 A pair of mammoth, ornate chests of drawers
stand before you, carved from wood so pure and
polished it gleams white as bone [1,500 gp each].
Each armoire’s six drawers are tipped with solid
platinum handles, each inlaid with a semiprecious
green agate. Pulling open the drawers,
you find ladies’ finery, neatly folded. The clothes
are exclusively silk, smooth and cool to the
touch, and are ornamented with precious stones,
glistening silver thread and golden filigree.
[Every drawer but one holds a royal outfit suited for
a tall, statuesque woman; 11 total, 200 gp each.]
Opening a lower drawer, you find a glimmering,
silvery rapier [mithral, 1020 gp] with an ornate
hand guard on which a courtly dance is depicted
in low relief. It is cushioned with seductively
perfumed silk underclothes [350 gp total].
Atop the dresser is a collection of perfumes in
slender mother-of-pearl vials [14 vials, 100 gp
each], a golden mirror with a handle shaped like
a graceful female dancer [292 gp], an ivory and
onyx comb [308 gp] and a heavy, knotted gold
choker with a fruit and floral motif [421 gp]. An
ivory pyxis [makeup pot, 100 gp], whose sides are
painted with scenes from a woman’s daily toilette,
holds a waxy, cream-colored paste smelling
of honey and olive oil.
A nearby iron strongbox is secured by a masterwork
clockwork lock [amazing lock; 190 gp]
and holds additional wealth. Opening the case,
you see finger-sized platinum strips, covered in
vine tracery, resting on the green velvet shelves
inside [9 strips; 500 gp each]. A necklace of black
pearls and rainbow glass beads [3,500 gp] is
coiled just below the platinum strips. A golden
torque, its heads sculpted as screaming lions
with poorly carved eyes [450 gp] sits atop a pile
of gold and silver coins [172 gp, 218 sp].
In a small pile beneath the armoire are five
grapefruit-sized hemp bags [2 sp each] of uncut
‘raw’ stones. Each bag contains a mix of stones
including: moonstones [8 at 50 gp each], lapis
lazuli [10 at 10 gp each], peridots [8 at 50 gp each],
amethysts [5 at 100 gp each], topaz [2 at 500 gp
each], emeralds [3 at 1000 gp each] and blue sapphires
[5 at 1000 gp each]. None of the stones
have been shaped or polished, and a few are
deeply flawed. Mingled with the gems are cleverly
carved animals from an onyx and amber
game set, though only about half the pieces are
present [15 pieces total at 100 gp each]. [Total
29,825.8 gp]
09 [This treasure should be set either in a small building
or in an indoor area with access to the sky through a
window or similar. If this is not possible, then the
individual items could be packed safely in crates and
protected by tarpaulin or similar.] The first thing
you see is an enormously long and broad spying
glass, pointing up into the sky though the roof.
The glass is as long as a spear but thrice as broad.
Surely even very distant objects could be seen
with such a powerful tool. Underneath, a cunningly
placed and designed leather chair is provided
for an observer to sit in comfort, despite
the need to lean back at quite an unusual angle
[telescope and chair 10,000 gp]. A plain wooden
table [5 gp] next to the chair holds a large number
[17] of parchment charts which, looking at
them, seem to be complex representations of
dots and spaces with various calculations and
times noted in a neat and easily legible hand.
With a start, you realize these are maps of the
night sky made at different times and locations,
presumably accurate although you find it impossible
to tell. [These charts are especially valuable
when navigating in unknown territory, by sea or on
land. As an added option, some could show unexpected
movements of stars associated with supernatural
or prophesied events, 500 gp each.]
Beneath the table is a series of six small crates
[1 gp each] which contain, carefully protected by
straw and padding, spare parts for the giant spytable
VIII: 30,000 gold pieces
137
glass, including two new lenses and the many
small parts constituting the pointing mechanism
[total value 1,000 gp]. A small chest of drawers
[15 gp] positioned some way behind the table
has, proudly sitting on top, a statue, more than
two feet tall and made from ivory, depicting the
ship of the stars, a well known local myth in
which young maidens are taken (willingly) on
board a large sailing ship which then voyages
beyond the stars [it can depict something else if
required, 2,500 gp]. Inside the chest of drawers
are mostly old notes and doodles of little value
but there is one final delight: in a small,
unadorned wooden box [1 gp] you find a silver
stick pin magnificently garnished with a large
diamond cut so as to suggest an exploding star
[8,000 gp]. [Total 30,027 gp]
10 Balanced on its side you discover an enormous
sundial [22,380 gp; weight nearly 200 pounds]. It
is wrought of bright, gleaming gold the color of
goldenrod pollen, and shaped in a stylized rendition
of a sunflower: the flat surface is carved in
many rises and hills, graduating out to a frame of
small, oval petals, then tapering into a thick
‘stem’, where a subtle hollow suggests the device
was meant to rest upon a slim but sturdy pillar.
Set along the outer edge of the sundial are gems
to mark the passing of hours: four opals and six
sapphires alternating. Two gems seem to have
been pried out by thieves’ hands—only hollows
remain where the gems once rested. Stacked
next to the sundial are four white quartz tiles
[1,000 gp each], each the length and width of a
man’s outstretched hand and set with delicate
depictions of flora in gold leaf. The first tile you
lift shimmers in the gloom, and portrays the
drowsy leaves of meadowsweet. The next tile
pictures a robust sprig of juniper, with small circles
of gold for its berries. The third tile in the
group depicts a gathering of rosemary, and the
last tile shimmers with a tableau of gathered
peppermint. Resting next to these is a suit of full
plate armor [1,500 gp], covered in a prodigious
layer of dust. Beyond the armor are other treasures:
an exquisitely wrought brass spyglass
[1,000 gp], 70 feet of coiled iron chain [210 gp],
and nine large, rolled tapestries [100 gp each].
Each woolen tapestry is expertly woven and
depicts a hunting scene in vibrant reds and
greens, with generous, rich brown and black dye;
time and neglect have done little to age them.
[Total 29,990 gp]
11 [The setting for this treasure will affect the atmosphere
and feel considerably. It is presented as being
in an underground cavern, as that was the location
of the original inspiration: the Terracotta Army of
Xian. However, this requires quite a large area—
approximately 50 yards wide by 60 long and at least
a couple yards high—so the treasure could also be
outdoors in a remote place or have already been
transported from its original location.] In the
uncertain light it is a spooky scene. Scores, perhaps
hundreds, of figures stand in front of you,
completely motionless. The air is so silent and
still it seems impossible that any life exists here
and after a moment or two, you realize this is
indeed the case: all of these people standing in
front of you are in fact statues. As you move
closer to observe, you can see they are all entirely
unique statues; despite being arranged in formal
ranks and apparently all dressed and armed
the same, each has distinctive facial characteristics
and small variations. After a few more
moments, the formation starts to make sense—
this is the representation of an army or, at least,
an armed bodyguard. In the center are ranks of
infantry. You count four rows of fifty such
infantry, divided between those armed with
spears and carrying large shields and those bearing
bows with nocked arrows. To either side is a
small force of cavalry, with four ranks of five
horsemen on both the left and the right flanks.
The cavalrymen are armored, although the horses
are not, and they carry lances and shields and
also have crossbows and quarrels slung over
their backs. The cavalrymen have high cheekbones
and slightly slanted eyes as if they came
from a distant place. Finally, somewhat hidden
at the rear of the infantry is a single chariot,
which is drawn by four horses and which holds
an unarmored driver and a heavily armored,
very tall man with a large halberd who is presumably
some kind of champion or king. These
statues are so nicely detailed that, although
made of plain terracotta, they would definitely
be of value to collectors—or as garden ornaments.
[Value: 200 infantry statues at 100 gp each;
40 cavalry statues at 200 gp each; 1 chariot set worth
2,000 gp. Of course, if the statues are left intact they
will eventually become of incalculable archaeological
and monetary value. Total 30,000 gp]
12 This room holds two nearly identical riding saddles,
one slightly larger than the other, both
heavily tooled and set with a dozen small bloodstones
[saddles 800 gp each] and a box made of
red and pale white woods, inlaid with red and
black stones [five each rhodochrosite and hematite;
box 500 gp]. Scattered around these are numerous
darts [74, 5 sp each], bolts [45, 2 sp each],
bolas [16, 5 gp each] and two scimitars with a
pair of white opals in each hilt [2,300 gp each].
A sack holds an iron skillet [2 gp] and two tin
pans [5 cp each]. Inside the wood and stone box
the mother of all treasure tables
138
you find six rings and five bracelets. One gold
ring has a single large pearl [150 gp]. A silver
ring has four moonstones [210 gp]. Large white
opals grace two rings, one gold [1,040 gp], the
other platinum [1,500 gp]. The fifth ring is platinum
with a blue-white diamond [5,500 gp]. The
last ring has a pale aquamarine between three
rock crystals [750 gp]. A silver bracelet has eight
pieces of turquoise [100 gp]. The next has twelve
silver figures danging from it: tiny animals,
buildings and symbols, some with moving parts
[charm bracelet, 280 gp]. Golden pearls dangle
from a third bracelet [gold with 8 golden pearls;
900 gp]. The fourth is a plain platinum band set
with seven black star sapphires [7,200 gp] and
the last is a double platinum band, intricately
knotted [120 gp]. Under the shelf with the rings
and bracelets, you find a string of twenty silver
pearls [2,200 gp] and a pendant of one black and
two white opals [3,010 gp]. Behind the box some
clothing lies atop a sack of coins [368 gp, 345 sp,
7,551 cp]. You find numerous sets of men’s shirts
and matching silk hose [silk, white and cream, 8
sets each; 20 gp each set], red wool scarves [15
scarves, 2 sp each], and a child’s purple silk skirt
[5 gp]. [Total 30,588.1]
13 An ornate suit of red-lacquered full plate armor
[adamantine; 16,500 gp] lies sprawled drunkenly
over a pair of heavy pine and steel war chests [4
gp each]. Every inch of the beautiful armor, from
the crest of its helm to the heels on its silver
spurred boots is the same flat shade of crimson.
A cloak of woven wool [74 gp], dyed a deep purple,
falls like a waterfall of dark wine from the
armor’s bulky shoulders. The sleeves of the
armor have been deeply etched with looping circles
and interlaced ring designs, which cover the
wearer’s biceps. The armor’s helm [550 gp] dangles
from the armor by its chin strap. The helm
is fully enclosed, and has a pair of short bull’s
horns rising from the forehead, rendered in
obsidian entwined by silver.
Moving the amazing armor from its rest atop
the chests, you discover a miniature woven tapestry
[2,600 gp] which lay concealed under the
armor’s breastplate. Unrolling the tapestry, you
are amazed by the quiet detail of a winter scene,
showing the daily life of the peasantry during
the cold months. The exquisite tapestry can be
rolled up into a backpack easily, and is dominated
by clean white thread, offset by delicate blue
and brown line work and accented with silver.
Opening the first chest, you discover a collection
of religious items. Votive candles embedded
in wax-covered golden sconces [5; 130 gp each],
golden censers dangling from long silver chains
[3; 270 gp each], and waxed bags of fragrant
incense [7; 50 gp each] lie atop a neatly folded set
of priestly vestments. The heavy robes have
been sewn exclusively with golden thread, and
are backed by silken panels traced with prayers.
Ten sets of vestments stuff the chest [comparable
to royal outfits; 200 gp each]. A small collection
of religious medals, made from hammered copper
and inset with chips of amber, lines the bottom
of the chest [23 medals, 10 gp each].
The second wooden chest has been packed to
the lid with dried dates, pecans and walnuts [200
pounds, 5 sp each]. Sifting through the nuts, you
discover a heavy golden pectoral in the shape of
a falcon with outspread wings, inlaid with pieces
of lapis and jet using the cloisonnÈ technique.
This massive piece is valuable for its exacting
craftsmanship as well as the precious materials
[6,200 gp]. [Total 30,072 gp]
14 Standing mannequins fill this area, each one
adorned with a set of armor. You also notice a
medium-sized chest at the far end of this area.
As you approach the chest you see the lock has
been broken off, apparently some time ago
because the entire chest, including the lock, is
covered with a thick layer of dust. As you open
the chest you see the gleam of coins and you
wonder why the person who broke the lock didn’t
take the loot. The chest contains a mixture
of silver and gold coins [10,393 gp; 15,456 sp].
After making sure there is nothing else of
interest in the chest you turn your attention to
the mannequins. There are a total of fourteen
standing dummies. You approach the nearest
and your eyes fall upon studded leather armor. It
is also extremely dusty, and you notice as you
scan the room again all of the armor is covered
in a thick layer of filthy powder. The three dummies
beside the one you’re looking at also wear
studded leather armor. You brush the dust off of
the leather nearest you and find it is a fine piece
of protective covering. Each of the four sets is
made of hard, dark leather, and each one has a
medium sized amethyst sewn into the left chest
area [masterwork, 260 gp each].
You move down the line and observe the next
five mannequins are adorned with sets of halfplate
armor. Each set also has an amethyst
pressed into the plate at the left chest area [masterwork,
850 gp each]. The last five dummies are
covered with full plate mail armor. Removing
the dust from each set reveals truly splendid
masterwork pieces of body protection which,
like the rest, have an amethyst pressed into it
[1,750 gp each].
Turning back towards the way you came, you
are surprised by what you see. Two golden tower
shields rest up against each other. You can’t
table VIII: 30,000 gold pieces

imagine actually using them in battle; they seem
to be designed as show pieces, but the quality of
workmanship is remarkable [2,300 gp each].
[Total 30,578.6 gp]
15 You find a huge wooden idol [unadorned idol, 390
gp] depicting a huge-breasted squatting woman
with a crown of antlers on her head, which is
easily twice life sized. One of the goddess’ eyes is
missing, and the wood nearby is scarred by
cracks and pry marks, but the other socket holds
a golden ‘eye’ with a blue sapphire ‘iris’ the size
of man’s thumb nail [eye, 1,542 gp]. Three thick
golden chains have been draped over the
antlers, and one of these heavy necklaces ends
in a fire-opal pendant shaped like a teardrop [2
plain chains, 400 gp each; chain with pendant;
1,405 gp]. The idol wears giant-scale jewels,
including a long platinum torque around her
neck, beaten thin and engraved with crocodiles
as well as archers hunting the great beasts
[torque, 1,450 gp]. Massive rings (which would
be bracelets on your wrists) made of gold and
onyx adorn each of the goddess’ 12 fingers [12
rings, 150 gp each]. One of the idol’s wooden feet
has been shattered, but the other displays six
hammered gold toenails, each studded with a
different semi-precious stone [amber, green
spinel, amethyst, chrysoberyl, garnet and jet; jeweled
toenails, 200 gp each].
Nearby, a huge wooden chest [3 gp] contains
a complete suit of blue steel plate mail, whose
armored sections have been carved like dragon’s
scales [masterwork; 9,000 gp]. Each of the ‘scales’
of the breastplate is decorated with an inset
white pearl, while the armor’s shoulder plates
are studded with short obsidian blades.
Gauntlets, boots and greaves lie atop the armor,
all made of the same blue steel, and sprinkled
with white pearls. A teardrop-shaped shield at
the bottom of the chest is made of heavy steel.
On it is a mosaic made of gold chips and shards
of topaz, obsidian and hematite which depicts
the family’s coat of arms: a famous saint, holding
a sword in one hand, and shortbow in another
[3,400 gp].
Next to the chest is a smooth ivory box
secured by a bronze and gold lock [Amazing lock;
box, 500 gp]. Inside the gleaming box, lies even
more wealth. You find, a small square-cut emerald
[750 gp], a green-tinged diamond as big
around as a fat pea [4,500 gp], thirteen platinum
strips shaped like shields [10 pp each], a ring of
twenty-five silver keys on a golden chain [keys,
15 gp each; chain, 100 gp], and a pile of gold and
silver coins [1424 gp, 4090 sp]. Each item is
marked on an inventory found at the bottom of
the box. [Total 30,348 gp]
16 A large object is draped in copious amounts of
stained and faded silken cloth [200 yards, 5 gp
each], only half-hidden as you can see one wheel
and a pole which the silk has failed to hide.
Pulling away the fabric reveals a magnificent
carriage [3,000 gp] built of pale, golden-hued
wood with darker, almost black, wooden trimmings.
The doors, driver’s seat and rear basket
are painted a rich, lustrous red, and the door
handles are wrought of gold. Ivory inlay on the
doors depicts intricate floral patterns, with a
peacock hidden among the leaves. The doors are
unlatched, and the carriages windows have been
stripped of their curtains, so it is a simple matter
to look inside and see more items lie there.
A granite bust [1,445 gp] of a woman rests
upon the wooden floor of the carriage. Her face
is one barely touched by maturity, yet her
expression is ancient beyond her years. Upon
one passenger seat is a delicate bridal caul
[23,200 gp], made of silvery lace and sewn with
four pale, yellow diamonds the color of spring
wine. Two gray velvet strips hang from the headband
to frame the wearer’s face, and these are
each adorned with three fire opals. Once the
caul is lifted from the seat you can see two more
lady’s adornments: a gold arm cuff [1,300 gp],
fashioned in a complex pattern of symmetrical
braiding and sized for a slender woman’s upper
arm, and a single golden earring [555 gp]. The
earring is about four coins in height and is
remarkably heavy, and probably uncomfortable
to wear. The earring consists of a winged sphinx
perched on a pedestal decorated with tongues of
beaded wire filled with blue and green enamel.
The tongues are framed above and below by a
smooth molding inside a row of beading. The
sphinx has a prominent rounded chest and
flared wings which curve inward. The sphinx
wears a beaded necklace and a headdress decorated
with a row of beading beneath filigree
ornamentation of palmettes and vine leaves.
[Total 30,500 gp]
17 [Depending on circumstances, the longship in this
treasure may either be of recent construction and
therefore still usable (value 10,000 gp, not included
in treasure value) or else aged and decrepit and of
little use. If it is buried underground or else far from
water, then it should be considered an ancient artifact
and too fragile for use]. An amazing sight
greets your eyes as an entire longship has been
mounted on a giant pyre as if ready for the
flame—a flame which has never yet met the
straw, even though that straw is now so dry and
old that it would surely explode in a great shower
of sparks and fire should a match be put to it.
Intrigued, you climb, a little gingerly, aboard the
the mother of all treasure tables
140
boat. The oars are stacked neatly in their houses
and rows of round, wooden, painted shields
are tied along each rail of the ship. In the centre
of the main deck is a second, smaller pyre, with
the recognisable shape of a person atop it. You
investigate further to find a figure armored in
gold chainmail, beside which lies a huge battleaxe
with a gold blade [gold chainmail, 6,000
gp; gold greataxe, 2,500 gp]. These accoutrements
certainly seem wasted on a pyre!
[If the armor is removed:] The man inside the
armor looks like he was once a testy, short-tempered
individual of no great stature, although
these judgments are difficult to make with longdead
corpses. Looking next below decks, you are
delighted to find a hold packed with good and
valuable objects. There are eight casks of genuinely
high quality brandy [800 gp each], another
eight casks of lesser quality but still acceptable
apple brandy [400 gp each] and a further eight
casks of rare, fragrant mango brandy [1000 gp
each]. [The hold was airtight prior to its opening,
hence the comestibles are still in good order.] In
addition there are, concealed in a plain wooden
box, four long and heavy ingots of purest gold,
stamped with a dragon brand [20 pounds each;
1,000 gp each]. [Total 30,100 gp]
18 A large golden chest rests on a raised platform
against the wall. It is a grand sight to see, gleaming
in the light. You can only imagine what it
weighs, and what it alone may be worth, not
even considering its contents [chest weighs 50
pounds empty; 2,800 gp]. As you open it you are
not disappointed. It is obviously filled with
coins, but what catches your eye first rests on
the top. A goblet made of pure platinum lies on
its side, resting atop the coins. As you lift it you
notice the weight of it and can imagine the time
it took to craft such a beautiful cup [250 gp].
After you set the goblet down in a safe place you
take the time to sift through the coins [9,800 gp;
4,500 sp]. Your hand touches something which
is obviously not a coin and you retrieve another
platinum goblet, just like the first [250 gp]. You
set the cup next to its twin, now a matched set.
Reaching into the chest again it isn’t long before
you recover another item, a small crystal sphere.
Although it is bright green in color, it is fairly
transparent. It is heavy in your hand as you stare
into it, noticing the subtle swirls of green running
through it [made of bright green emerald;
8,000 gp].
[If the party takes the chest off of the platform,
read the following:] As you move the chest away
from the raised platform you notice there is a
hole in the dais which was covered by the chest.
You look in and the glow of platinum fills your
eyes. It seems to be several hundred more coins
to add to the rest of the treasure you have found
this day [824 pp]. [Total 29,790 gp]
19 Half-buried in a pile of gold and silver coins
[2,359 gp; 17,800 sp], you find a life-sized marble
statue of an elven wizard [24,200 gp] with a
regular, fabric and fur cloak [1,100 gp] draped
over its back. A low shelf full of books is also
part of the statue, and the wizard is carved as if
leaning against this shelf. The front half of the
shelf is clearly hinged, as it is slightly ajar. You
see a heap of coins once held inside the statue;
both the wizard and shelf are hollow.
The statue is lifelike to the last detail, and has
been carved out of a single massive piece of red
and dark green veined marble. Every fold of the
wizard’s voluminous robe drapes as if it were real,
and his expression is one of deep thought mixed
with mild surprise. One hand is raised to cup his
chin, and you find there are a few pieces of the
statue which are not marble: the hand sports
two rings, both made of platinum and are plain,
save that each bears the device of a different
elven family. In addition, the wizard’s eyes glint
with a mix of sparkling emeralds and deep red
star rubies [7 of each]. [If the platinum rings, emeralds
or star rubies are removed from the statue, any
one could be sold for 1,000 gp. However, the value
of the statue would be reduced to 5,000 gp.]
Examining the back of the statue, you find
the cloak is midnight blue silk trimmed with
ermine. A trio of intricate sunburst designs is
emblazoned on the cloak in gold thread. Lifting
the cloak, you see a quiver and bow set have also
been hung around the statue’s neck, hidden
from view until now. The composite shortbow
made of many layers of horn and wood. A custom-
sized quiver, which holds a sheaf of arrows,
is tied to the bow by the leather thongs which
would attach the quiver to an archer’s waist
[masterwork bow, 375 gp; quiver, 30 gp; 20 masterwork
arrows, 121 gp]. The red leather quiver is
etched with delicate leaf designs, and the fletching
on the arrows is bright blue. [Total value,
29,965 gp]
20 You find four large harps, each at least as half as
tall as an average man and beautifully designed.
The first has been made from a gorgeously
carved green stone and bursts with detail. Gold
strings run down from the upper arch of the
harp, and worked into the surface of the instrument
are images and designs of spring. The most
prominent is a whimsical elfin maiden with
short spiky hair and a playful expression. [Spring
harp, green marble with gold strings; 7,500 gp]
The second harp has been formed from a
table VIII: 30,000 gold pieces
141
dark, almost rose-colored, golden metal which
gleams brightly. This instrument has intricate
detail and design as do the others, save that this
one is carved with icons of summer and fire. It
has bronze strings, and the image of a beautiful
flame-haired woman embossed upon it. She has
a wickedly amused expression and her eyes seem
to follow you everywhere. [Summer harp, gold
with bronze strings; 7,500 gp]
The third instrument has been carved with a
master sculptor’s eye for detail and is made from
a dark, brownish-red stone. This instrument has
a sombre look to it and seems much more understated,
both in design and creation. The strings
have a copper color to them as they run down
from the upper arch. This harp has the image of
a woman carved upon it, rather stern and unforgiving
with a mass of leaf-strewn curly hair.
[Autumn harp, marble with copper strings; 7,500 gp]
The last harp is made from a silvery white
material. The strings are silver and tiny icicles of
crystal hang down from the edges. Carved into
the surface of the instrument is the image of a
woman with a cold, callous expression and a
flow of long white hair. [Winter harp, mithral with
silver strings; 7,500 gp] [Total 30,000 gp]

I had not realized how heavy truly
fabulous treasure could be!
All sets are valued at 50,000 gold pieces plus or minus
2%, or in other words 49,000 to 51,000 gp. The italicized
text contains values and information reserved for the
game master. In general, the GM will not immediately
read this text to the players; it is there for the GM to use
as he or she sees fit.
Roll d10 and use the indicated set:
01 Treasure in a big pile is always a welcome site,
and the size of the treasure pile in this room is
quite satisfactory. Heaps of copper coins mixed
with silver, hills of gold and even small pockets
of platinum grace the floor in front of you. Items
stick out from the pile at random, promising
even more wealth than the mass of coins.
Popping out of the top of the stack are two halberds
[10 gp each] and a battleaxe [masterwork,
310 gp], all with their heads buried in the coins.
Past the weapons is a very attractive suit of full
plate armor with a set of spikes attached [masterwork
armor with masterwork spikes, sized for a
dwarf; 2,000 gp]. The spikes are somewhat rusty
but still in good working shape. A tower shield
completes the collection of armor and weapons.
It is particularly nice, and looks to have been
made more for show than actual battle. It is gilded
and covered with fancy filigree work from top
to bottom and shows no signs of being used
[masterwork, 530 gp].
The oddest thing you find is a spool of wire.
While not unusual in and of itself, this wire
appears to be made of pure gold, perhaps to be
used for decoration [200 feet of gold wire, 75 gp].
Resting under the wire is a fancy black cloak
decorated with freshwater pearls down the front
and on the hems of the sleeves [1,000 gp].
Tucked into one of the sleeves of the cloak is a
tiara made of silver. It is decorated with ten
small, clear gems which sparkle brilliantly in the
torchlight [zircon; tiara, 550 gp]. In a large pile of
gold coins, you locate a thick, gold necklace.
This is adorned with a pendant featuring a beautiful
blue-white stone in the center surrounded
by four smaller matching stones. The chain itself
is almost as thick as a man’s thumb [gold and diamond
necklace, 9,500 gp]. The last item you
locate is a silver serving tray [100 gp]. This is
carefully etched with pictures of a typical farm at
harvest, and through the center of the tray is
carved a name in a strange language. [The language
is Draconic; the name is “Astoran” or another
name of your choice. This can be either a famous
wizard or simply a random person].
Counting all of these coins would take an age,
but it could be time well spent; it looks as if you
may now possess a king’s ransom in ready cash
[1,469 pp, 15,341 gp, 46,458 sp, 131,672 cp;
194,940 coins total, weight about 3,900 pounds,
total value of coins 35,993.52 gp]. [Total
50,078.52 gp]
02 Before you stands a throne of enormous size
[38,735 gp]. The chair itself is big enough for
two men to sit on it simultaneously; built up on
a base of what appears to be basalt studded with
dozens of skulls of people, beasts and possibly
even supernatural beings, it is tall enough to
need a small stepladder to mount. [The original
owner used slaves to make a human pyramid for the
master to climb.] The frame of the chair itself is
made from pure silver, studded with a plethora
of small rough diamonds, emeralds, sapphires
and rubies. [There are 296 such gems, which are
uncut and worth about 100 gp each if detached.]
The seat of the throne is made from a fine, pale
leather and is well padded [If desired, this could be
human leather made from the skins of young
women, and the padding could be goose down combined
with human hair.] The armrests are a combination
of ebony and ivory, carved so as to suggest
giant talons bursting forth from the body of
the throne to catch and rend any brought before
it. Whalebone and amber combine to form the
legs of the chair. They too are carved, although
it is the baleful semblance of lifeless, drowned
sailors that emerges from them. All of the surfaces
of the throne and its base have been carefully
covered with a thin layer of light oil, to
keep them from being damaged by the air.
Positioned to one side of the throne, carefully
placed along the skull base, are three wide
padded stools [500 gp each], covered with very
fine silk and embroidered with complex, exquisite
illustrations of life after death and the various
torments it is likely to bring. Each circular
stool has a long platinum chain attached, which
ends in finely wrought manacles [3 platinum
chains, 20 feet long, 1,040 gp each; 3 sets of masterwork
platinum manacles, 560 gp each. Close
inspection reveals one stool has a hard lump near the
Table IX:
50,000 Gold Pieces
143
edge seam. A small hole in the seam gives access to
the lumpy piece, a large yellowish stone more than
an inch in diameter; citrine, 5,637 gp]. [Total
50,672 gp]
03 The wealth of a kingdom is piled high atop a
golden chariot [12,500 gp]. One of the chariot’s
gilded iron wheels is warped and bent, and so
the majestic vehicle leans drunkenly. The chariot’s
‘castle’ is decorated with a relief showing an
ancient, mitered king single-handedly defeating
a charging army. The king’s flesh is hammered
silver against the golden background, and stars
in the relief’s sky are pebble-sized diamonds.
Every inch of the gleaming vehicle has been
decorated with tightly laced sheets of hammered
gold and starbursts of garnets blossom from the
gilded chariot’s hull on both sides.
Sifting through the treasure tossed into the
chariot’s bed, you revel in the fortune found
here. You could run your fingers through hundreds
of slender golden rings, simple open crescents
which could be worn individually, or fitted
together to make long decorative chains and
gleaming shawls. [These are similar to rings used to
make chainmail, about 100 pounds in all; 10,000
rings, 5 sp each; total for rings, 5,000 gp.]
Piled with the rings are several amazing
weapons. There is a bastard sword whose cruciform
hilt is set with more than a dozen smooth
off-white stones [chalcedony; masterwork bastard
sword, 1,490 gp] and a pair of platinum
nunchuku whose striking surfaces are scored
with mazelike patterns, and whose chain has
pure silver links [masterwork nunchuku; 1,412
gp]. The most valuable weapon in the pile is a
shortbow of glistening dark wood [or bamboo]
encircled by four jade bands, whose bowstring is
some type of braided hair which is absolutely
pure white [unicorn hair; masterwork shortbow,
2,975 gp]. But all the weapons in the pile are
striking, even one which seems to serve no practical
purpose: a ceremonial dagger whose hilt is
shaped as a crouching priest and whose blade is
razor-sharp rose quartz [2,600 gp].
A high-gloss blue and white vase with elaborate
scenes of shores, waves, diving fish and fantastic
sea creatures [vase, 3,000 gp] stands in the
middle of the pile. Within the tall wax-stoppered
vase is a fantastic collection of seashells,
ranging from twisted cones as long as your foot
and curving spirals the size of your outstretched
hand to tiny horn-shaped shells. [6 large shells
(6-10 inches), 10 gp each; 15 medium shells (3-4
inches), 1 gp each; 57 small shells (1-1.5 inches), 8
cp each; 210 tiny shells (.5 inch or less), 5 per cp;
total for all shells, 79.98 gp. Shells may be worth as
much as 10 times the amount given in locations far
from the sea.] Mixed in with these is a necklace
of circular, flat black stones [obsidian; necklace
700 gp] whose chest-sized pendant is in the
shape of a dangly, multi-jointed sea creature
[octopus; pendant 1,010 gp] made of pieces of the
same black stone and copper wire. Also among
the shells you find a miniature ivory scroll case
painted like a garter snake [32 gp]. It is designed
to be clasped to a falcon’s leg and hold tiny missives.
Within the tube, you discover five perfectly
cut diamonds of stunning clarity [3,800 gp
each]. [Total 49,798.98 gp]
04 You find two chests and a pile of weapons here.
There are five tridents, well made and sturdy
[masterwork, 315 gp each] and five high quality
short swords [masterwork, 310 gp each]. Beside
these is a pile of silk rope and lead balls, tied
together somehow. A little sorting resolves the
pile into five weighted nets [masterwork, 320 gp
each].
The first chest is pale wood, polished and
carved throughout with icons of the sea: shells,
shore birds, fish, waves, and even merfolk peeping
out here and there. The chest has a very
sturdy lock and is bound shut with leather straps
[Amazing lock; chest, 190 gp]. Inside you catch
the gleam of silver among pieces of light green.
A closer look shows you a set of full plate armor,
wonderfully wrought and incredibly strong, with
its outer surfaces enameled in a pale green the
color of sea foam [masterwork adamantine full
plate armor; 17,150 gp].
The second chest is smaller, of a wood which
has faded almost to gray but is sanded and
smooth. Inside are three sets of cleric’s vestments
in sea-foam green [5 gp each]. Below is a
pink silk robe, extensively embroidered in a
green so pale it is almost white and sprinkled
heavily with small pearls [high priestess’ robe; 550
gp]. In the bottom are a polished box of ash
wood [4 gp] and a small casket covered with
gleaming mother of pearl, so much that the outside
of the wood can no longer be seen [casket
180 gp]. The hinges and latch are of silver. You
open the casket and see before you a mass of glistening
pink. Hundreds of pale pink pearls are
joined in a lustrous, three-strand necklace. The
pearls are arranged in graduated sizes by strand,
but are not quite perfect or perfectly matched.
They are nonetheless beautiful, especially in
such a mass [88 medium pearls, 103 small pearls,
118 smaller pearls; necklace 16,320 gp]. Below the
necklace lies a golden pectoral which features a
pale green stone [aquamarine] at the center
front, a flat oval nearly as long as an egg [pectoral,
6,780 gp]. A pink silk bag [1 gp] under the
pectoral holds a silver ring with a pink pearl the
the mother of all treasure tables
144
size of a large grape [ring, 2,300 gp]. The box
holds an unusual crossbow, made of shell and
coral [heavy crossbow, 50 gp] and a white leather
pouch [2 gp] full of platinum coins [230 pp].
[Total 50,377 gp]
05 You cannot miss the large mass of black which
sits before you upon a floor covered with gleaming
silver and glistening gemstones. [70,000 sp;
the coins are all from the same country and about
the same age. A search reveals 28 gems: 3 pieces of
amber, 70 gp each; 5 amethysts, 100 gp each; 6 silver
pearls, 100 gp each; 7 pieces of jade, 130 gp
each; 2 pieces of jet, 140 gp each; 5 deep green
spinels, 100 gp each] It looks like a perfectly
intact coach of some kind, made from a dark
seasoned wood, lacquered pitch black and inlaid
with a white material [ivory] in curving patterns
[coach, 19,560 gp total]. The coach has red velvet
curtains and a dark red leather lining on all
the seats. [Six people could travel in this in comfort.]
All four of the doors bear an elaborate crest
[royal symbol from any kingdom] in gold, accented
with black stones, denoting the high status of
this contraption. [Each crest is accented with 4
black pearls and 2 black sapphires. If removed from
the doors, pearls are worth 500 gp each, sapphires
1,000 gp each; they reduce the value of the coach by
the value of the stone + 10%.] The wheels and
spokes have been covered with silver and each
wheel features a large polished red stone in its
center [garnets, 2 inches in diameter; if removed
from coach they are worth 1,000 gp each and reduce
value of coach by 1,100 gp each]. At the front, the
tongue of the coach — where horses would be
tied — is missing but there is no sign of damage.
A rather large chest made from black wood has
been cast aside at the back of the coach. Its lid,
which lies askew, prominently bears a smaller
version the same gold crest found on the coach
doors, set in a circle of nine tourmalines. [Good
lock; chest, 1,110 gp; the top left hinge is damaged
and must be repaired before the chest can be used
normally.]
Laid out inside the coach are several gorgeous
dresses designed to fit a slim, petite woman.
They are identical in style but differ in the material
from which they are made. There is a red
velvet dress with amber stones and gold embroidery,
and a light blue silk with amethysts and
embroidery in shades from pale lavender to deep
purple. A black satin dress is decorated with
white and silver pearls and moonstones, and
embellished with striking white stitching.
Finally, a white dress of fine linen is trimmed
with pale green beryls and embroidered with the
colors of every green leaf you have ever seen. [4
dresses, 5,000 gp each] [Total 50,670 gp]
06 [This treasure requires quite a large area – the equivalent
of a fair-sized hall. If this is not available, then
all objects can be found carefully packed into secure
crates, protected by straw and wool padding and the
players can amuse themselves by having the heroes
try to reconstruct the skeletons into some approximation
of their real configuration.] You seem to
have entered some form of amazing collection
[museum]. The central area is dominated by two
enormous skeletons, each one a dozen paces or
more long and just as high. Judging from the
shape and size of the first, it was in life an enormous
swimming beast as big as a boat and with a
huge spike projecting out of its snout [similar to a
blue whale skeleton; 3,000 gp]. The second must
surely have been a giant, erect lizard with monstrous
jaws but tiny forelegs which could scarcely
reach its mouth [tyrannosaurus rex skeleton;
5,000 gp].
Behind these two behemoths are wooden
cases with glass fronts, which range all across the
wall. The cases contain a couple hundred different
golden statues of what you take to be a primitive
fertility goddess, with broad thighs and
ample bosom. The statues vary in size from
thumb high to as much as a forearm’s length.
Although all are recognizably of the same subject,
they differ considerably in terms of nature
and style, for some seem friendly and kind while
others are distinctly fierce and even seem judgmental
of the observer. [35 large statues (12-18
inches), 145 gp each; 91 medium statues (6-10
inches), 85 gp each; 147 small statues (2-4 inches),
42 gp each; statues, 18,984 gp total]
A second row of glass-front cases on another
wall houses examples of minerals and rough precious
stones of every possible description. Here
are opals, lapis lazuli, marble, granite, carnelian
pieces and many others in a variety of sizes, colors
and settings. Literally hundreds of stones
compete for your attention. [281 mineral specimens,
5 gp each; 85 rough semi-precious stones, 50
gp each; 19 rough precious stones, 500 gp each; 385
stones in all, total value 15,155 gp.]
Finally, a third wall of the display has still
more of the ubiquitous cases which this time
contain several varieties of ships in bottles.
There are sixteen altogether and they range
from a fairly crude attempt to force a small
dugout canoe into a glass ale bottle [30 gp] to a
hugely complex galleon with sails and rigging
fully replicated, carefully housed in a crystal bottle
big enough for twenty gallons of rum [2,000
gp]. [2 ships, 925 gp each; 4 ships, 560 gp each; 3
ships, 310 gp each; 4 ships, 180 gp each; 2 ships,
115 gp each; total for all ships in bottles, 8,000 gp.]
The cases themselves are fixed to the walls and
table IX: 50,000 gold pieces

cannot be removed without rendering them useless.

07 A huge statue [of a familiar deity] which must
have stood by [or hung on] the wall of a temple
lies ahead of you. The statue is marble, plated
with gold [10,256 gp]. The deity’s head is topped
by a crown with places for two center gems and
eight others around the edge. A few stones are
missing, but one deep blue sapphire and five violet
garnets remain, and blue spinels sparkle all
along the cuffs and hem of the painted blue
robe. Beside the statue, a large strong wooden
box with a sturdy lock [Good lock; box, 85 gp]
holds twenty sets of eating utensils, each with
two knives, three forks and three spoons. All are
gold, and have a gem in the handle. Each set has
the same gem and pattern, but no two sets are
the same. The gems are pink or silver pearls, red
or green spinels, tourmalines, jets, red or greenish
garnets, amethysts or chrysoberyls [152 utensils
with gems, 200 gp each].
A lidded iron pot large enough to cook a
sheep [10 gp] sits behind the statue. Inside the
pot you find a leather traveling sack with little
pockets. In each pocket is a small pouch containing
a dried herb or spice in varying amounts:
cloves, cinnamon, dried garlic, fennel, sage,
turmeric, saffron, basil, ginger, dill and others
[sack of 15 spices, 80 gp]. Underneath it are a tall
black felt hat [5 sp], a white wool cloak lined in
rabbit fur [15 gp] and a tall pair of large black
leather boots, elaborately tooled [10 gp]. A small
leather sack [5 sp] holds a gold necklace laden
with moonstones [15 stones; necklace, 820 gp]
and a separate silver pendant of black and white
opals [2 white, 1 black; pendant 3,010 gp], and a
heavy gold ring with a round ruby [1,250 gp].
Behind the pot you find a small shoulder bag
holding a blank, leather-bound book with vellum
pages [15 gp], ink [8 gp], four inkpens [1 sp
each] and a penknife with an ivory handle [5 gp].
Next to it is a longsword with a bloodstone in
the hilt [sword, 70 gp] in a dark leather sheath [3
gp]. Piles of coins litter the floor underneath it
all [723 gp, 1,789 sp, 3,506 cp]. Small gems scattered
among the coins glint in the light [45 blue
quartz and 37 hematite, 10 gp each; 25 rock crystal,
50 gp each; 11 amethysts, 100 gp each]. [Total
50,145.36 gp]
08 Atop a heap of smashed chests and mixed coins
[6,500 gp, 24,540 sp, 180,000 cp] stands a lifesized
lion which appears to be made of solid gold
[28,000 gp]. Maneuvering the lion down from
the top of the pile [no mean feat, as it weighs 500
pounds], you set it down on the floor in front of
you. The beast is masterfully carved, every detail
breathing life into the figure: its mane is swept
back as if the lion were in mid-stride, its eyes
glint menacingly, and you can make out the
countless individual strands of hair in its coat.
Turning back to the heap, you can see the
smashed remnants of at least six large chests,
which look as though they were chopped apart
with axes. Buried among the thousands of coins
you find six steel locks [Amazing locks, still locked
and with no keys present; 150 gp each], a bejeweled
longsword [masterwork, 2,600 gp], seven
gnomish hooked hammers with wire-wrapped
handles [20 gp each], a dozen silver candlesticks
shaped like slender castle towers [50 gp each],
two marble goblets with translucent quartz
stems [350 gp each], three silver combs [40 gp
each], a wooden statue of a graceful fawn, with
one of its legs broken off [70 gp], a large bronze
bowl, the rim of which is studded with bits of
lapis lazuli [300 gp], a hunting horn carved from
a single large piece of bone [200 gp], a matched
pair of masterwork morningstars [308 gp each]
and a marble sphere the size of a small barrel of
ale [5,000 gp].
The longsword is finely made, with a tapered
point and a long groove down the center of the
blade. Its handle is made of horn covered in tiny
brass studs, while its crosspiece is a thick wedge
of steel; the pommel stone is an irregular chunk
of red-veined marble. Just at the point where the
hilt joins the crosspiece, it is set with two blazing
fire opals.
Equally interesting is the large marble sphere,
which is covered with carvings of demonic
heads leering from flaming doorways, devils
dragging pegasi from the sky with long, barbed
chains and fiends with forked tongues impaling
elves on wooden stakes. From its weight [close to
800 pounds], you guess the sphere is solid marble.
[Though not magical, the sphere has been used in rituals
of demonic summoning; it is up to the GM
whether or not it provides any benefit in such rituals.]
[Total 50,000 gp]
09 In the center of the room is a rocking horse, the
kind with which a child would play, though this
sturdy horse would fit even a youth of twelve.
You cannot imagine any child being allowed to
play with this piece of art, though. The horse is
carved entirely from silver and the detail is
astounding [28,520 gp]. As you approach it the
quality workmanship which produced this item
is even more apparent. Upon closer inspection
you notice what at first looks like a flaw in the
craftsmanship of the horse, but as you get closer
you can tell it is instead a square crack in the
back of the horse. It does not take long to determine
the crack is a hatch, with a very small prothe
mother of all treasure tables
146
trusion which acts as a handle. The small hatch
lifts off easily to reveal a dark inner compartment.
The first thing you find inside are two
sacks [2 sp each] of platinum pieces [804 pp, 928
pp]. You again reach into the hollow horse and
retrieve a small [5-inch long] replica of a warhammer.
The detail on this item easily equals that of
the rocking horse from which you retrieved it.
The handle is made of a very dark wood, with
the head forged from solid gold [hammer, 400
gp]. It can obviously serve no real purpose in battle,
but it is impressive to behold nonetheless.
Next you pull a small polished box from the cavity.
It is a half-cubit square with a hinged lid.
The edges of the top of the box are lined with
crystals inset into the wood. When you open the
box it immediately begins to play a hauntingly
beautiful tune. You then notice the crank at the
back of the box that is used to wind it up. This
elegant music box is truly impressive [1,340 gp].
You reach into the opening another time and
feel one last item. It is a platinum dish the size
of a large dinner plate. Upon inspecting it you
notice words and numbers carved on it in a circular
pattern. [This is a very cleverly fashioned perpetual
calendar, accurate from 100 years in the past
up to 500 years in the future; 2,388 gp]. [Total
49,968.4 gp]
10 In the darkness [moonlight; glow of the fire; bright
sunlight; gloom] looms what can only be a gigantic,
monstrous cage [35,050 gp]. As you get closer
to it you can see the bars of the cage are
wrought of adamantine and each bar is easily as
wide as a man’s hand is long. The bars reach to
a height of two men before curving to meet at a
gilded spike in the center. Each bar is engraved
with hundreds of protective words and warnings
in the common tongue of the land. Cautions
like ‘stay away’ and ‘do not bother the beast’ are
inscribed over and over again upon the bars of
the cage. The door is taller than a tall man, and
its lock [Amazing lock] is massive; a woman’s fist
could fit within it. The lock is fashioned to
resemble a lurid, horrible mouth, complete with
curved fangs and lolling tongue. An adamantine
skeleton key [300 gp] – nearly the size of a hardy
halfling – hangs by a thick, hempen rope [1 gp]
from the lowest crossbar. It could very well take
more than the strength of one man to turn the
key and unlock the cage. Next to the giant cage
is another large piece: a beautiful cabinet [9,349
gp] made of carved ivory and decorated with
brilliant green enamel. The cabinet stands a
man’s height and a half, and is almost as wide.
The top rises in peaks and spires, and the myriad
shelves and drawers range in size from the
tiniest alcove to wide, deep drawers capable of
holding large books. One of the enameled handles
pulls out to reveal a writing surface. A drawer
holds a veritable bounty of parchment sheets
[1,800 in total, if they were to be counted; 5 sp
each; 900 gp total]. Many of the sheets are loosely
bound with string or twine in books of 100,
and all are in excellent condition. One of the
cabinet’s small drawers reveals a brass brooch
[600 gp] in the shape of a dolphin, set with a
tracing of moonstone inlay. Behind the large
cabinet you find another adamantine item. This
appears to be a shaffron [3,800 gp]—the barding
which covers a beast’s skull and snout. This particular
shaffron is unusually large, decorated
with small gilded bands. A brass, spiral horn protrudes
from the top of the shaffron, apparently
just for show. With some thought you can envision
the beast that might have worn this piece of
armor, and it could easily have been a griffon.
