1-6: The town guard cracks down on smuggling, going house to house in search of contraband.
7-10: A tribe of marauders (gnolls, ores, or goblins) moves into the area, putting the town on alert and forcing Eliander to call out the militia. The traditionalists chafe under his orders.
11-12: A mass breakout allows a crew of smugglers to escape the dungeons, increasing tension in town.
13-14: The dwarves make a spectacular find in the mine, sparking plans to expand their presence and the docks.
15-16: Eliander and the town guard are called away to help deal with a threat from the Dreadwood, leaving behind only a skeleton crew to keep the peace and watch the mine.
17-18: A new wave of immigrants from the north arrives in town, tilting the population such that the loyalists might win a majority in the next town council election.
19: A bloody battle against pirates leaves a Keoish naval squadron undermanned. The squadron comes to town to press local sailors into service. Eliander secretly passes along the names of hotheaded traditionalists for the press gangs to target.
20: Having found enough evidence to charge him, Eliander seizes Gellan and ships him to Seaton to face charges of smuggling. Riots break out in town.
