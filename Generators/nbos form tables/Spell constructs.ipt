Header: The spell constructs are beings of magic, they are made of magic itself and within their tattered robes are hundreds of tiny runes that form together, creating a body and mind. They are still very naive and cannot grasp complex issues of morality. Real emotions in particular are difficult for them to grasp and they find conversations with anyone to be fascinating. They are however, directly influenced by their master as he has been their only source of knowledge regarding the world so far. This means they have picked up on their masterâ€™s loathings and adoration on certain creatures and subjects.
